0,"Kayla's dad said that she had $210 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have $4 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster four times. A round of laser tag is $3. The roller coaster cost $7 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","The roller coaster will cost $28 per person because 7 x 4 = 28
Each person costs $35 because 4 + 3 + 28 = 35
6 total people can attend because 210 / 35 = 6
She can invite 5 friends because 6 - 1 =5
#### 5","

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the roller coaster rides:** Kayla wants to ride the roller coaster 4 times at $7 per ride, so that will cost 4 * $7 = $28.

2. **Calculate the cost of pinball tokens:** Kayla wants $4 in pinball tokens for herself and each friend. We'll represent the number of friends as 'f'. So the pinball token cost will be $4 * (f + 1) because Kayla also wants tokens.

3. **Calculate the cost of laser tag:** Kayla and her friends all want to play one round of laser tag at $3 per person. The total cost for laser tag will be $3 * (f + 1).

4. **Set up an equation representing the total cost:** The total cost of the party (laser tag + pinball tokens + roller coaster) must be less than or equal to Kayla's budget of $210.  So, the equation is: $3(f + 1) + $4(f + 1) + $28 <= $210

5. **Simplify and solve the equation:**
   *  $3f + $3 + $4f + $4 + $28 <= $210
   *  $7f + $35 <= $210
   *  $7f <= $210 - $35
   *  $7f <= $175
   *  f <= $175 / $7
   *  f <= 25

6. **Determine the maximum number of friends:** Since 'f' represents the number of friends, and 'f' must be a whole number, Kayla can invite a maximum of 25 friends.

5,"Elena's dad said that she had $190 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have $3 in game room tokens, and get to ride the bumper cars seven times. A round of bowling is $8. The bumper cars cost $12 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","The bumper cars will cost $84 per person because 12 x 7 = 84
Each person costs $95 because 3 + 8 + 84 = 95
2 total people can attend because 190 / 95 = 2
She can invite 1 friends because 2 - 1 =1
#### 1","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the bumper cars:** Elena wants to ride the bumper cars 7 times at $12 per ride, so the bumper cars will cost 7 * $12 = $84.

2. **Calculate the total cost of game room tokens:** Elena wants $3 in game room tokens for herself and each friend. We don't know the number of friends yet, so we'll represent the number of friends as 'x'. The total cost of tokens is 3 * (x + 1) = $3x + $3.

3. **Calculate the cost of bowling:** Elena and her friends (x + 1 people total) want to bowl one round at $8 per person, so bowling will cost 8 * (x + 1) = $8x + $8.

4. **Set up an equation for the total cost:** The total cost of the party must be less than or equal to Elena's budget of $190. So, the equation is:  ($8x + $8) + ($3x + $3) + $84 ≤ $190

5. **Simplify the equation:** Combine like terms: $11x + $95 ≤ $190

6. **Isolate the 'x' term:** Subtract $95 from both sides: $11x ≤ $95

7. **Solve for 'x':** Divide both sides by $11: x ≤ 8.63

8. **Determine the maximum number of friends:** Since Elena can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite a maximum of 8 friends.

Ibrahim collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.25 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,"The first 6 complexes have 6*400=2400 apartments
The 7th one has 2400*0.35=840 more apartments than those 6 combined. So it has 2400+840=3240 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 3240+2400=5640 apartments each time
That means he visits 5640*3=16920 apartments every week
So he makes 16920*¥0.25=¥4230 every week
#### 4230","

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 6 complexes:** 6 complexes * 400 apartments/complex = 2400 apartments

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex:** 2400 apartments * 0.35 = 840 apartments (the increase).  Then, 2400 apartments + 840 apartments = 3240 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments Ibrahim collects from:** 2400 apartments + 3240 apartments = 5640 apartments

4. **Calculate the number of collections per week:** Ibrahim collects from each place 3 times a week, and there are 7 places, so 3 collections/week * 7 places = 21 collections/week

5. **Calculate the total number of apartments collected from per week:** 5640 apartments * 21 collections/week = 118440 apartments collected per week

How much money does he make in a week?,"The first 5 complexes have 5*200=1000 apartments
The 6th one has 1000*0.45=450 more apartments than those 5 combined. So it has 1000+450=1450 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 1450+1000=2450 apartments each time
That means he visits 2450*2=4900 apartments every week
So he makes 4900*$0.25=$1225 every week
#### 1225","
Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 5 complexes:** 5 complexes * 200 apartments/complex = 1000 apartments.

2. **Calculate the size of the last complex:** The last complex is 45% bigger than the first 5 combined. So, increase in size = 1000 apartments * 0.45 = 450 apartments.  The last complex has 1000 + 450 = 1450 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments across all complexes:** 1000 apartments + 1450 apartments = 2450 apartments.

4. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:** Alejandro collects garbage twice a week from each complex, and there are 6 complexes.  So, total collections = 2 collections/week * 6 complexes = 12 collections per week.

5. **Calculate the total number of collections for all apartments per week:** Each collection is for all apartments, so we have 12 collections * 2450 apartments = 29400 apartment collections.

6. **Calculate Alejandro's total earnings per week:** He earns $0.25 per apartment collection, so his total earnings are $0.25/collection * 29400 collections = $7350.

10,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Sanjay has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 2/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 6+3=9 classes a day
That means he spends 35*9=315 minutes per day in class
So he spends 315*6=1890 minutes a week
That means he spends 1890*1/2=945 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 1890+945+945=3780 minutes per week
So he spends 3780/60=63 hours per week
#### 63","
Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. **Calculate daily regular class time:** A normal student has 6 periods in a day. Assuming each period is a standard length, we need to determine what that length is. While not explicitly mentioned, a standard period is 45 minutes. So, daily regular class time is 6 periods * 45 minutes/period = 270 minutes.

2. **Calculate daily extra class time:** Sanjay takes 3 extra classes, each 35 minutes long, for a total of 3 classes * 35 minutes/class = 105 minutes.

3. **Calculate Sanjay's total daily learning time:** Sanjay's total daily learning time is his regular class time plus his extra class time: 270 minutes + 105 minutes = 375 minutes.

4. **Calculate Sanjay's weekly learning time (Monday-Friday):** He attends classes for 6 days a week, but we assumed standard schedule only lasts Monday-Friday. So, his weekly learning time from Monday to Friday is 375 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 2250 minutes.

5. **Calculate total weekly learning time from extra learning on weekends:** Sanjay spends 2/4 (or 1/2) of his weekly minutes *on each* Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  That means on each weekend day, he spends 2250/2 = 1125 minutes.  Over the weekend, this is 1125 * 2 = 2250 minutes.

6. **Calculate Sanjay's total weekly learning time:** Add the weekday learning time and the weekend learning time: 2250 minutes + 2250 minutes = 4500 minutes.

7. **Convert total weekly learning time to hours:**  Divide the total minutes by 60 to convert to hours: 4500 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 75 hours.

12,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Thiago has to take 4 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends two-fifths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 6+4=10 classes a day
That means he spends 60*10=600 minutes per day in class
So he spends 600*5=3000 minutes a week
That means he spends 3000*2/5=1200 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 3000+1200+1200=5400 minutes per week
So he spends 5400/60=90 hours per week
#### 90","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate daily class time:** A normal student has 6 periods a day, but we don't know the length of each period. We only know Thiago has 4 *extra* classes, each 60 minutes long. The time spent in the extra classes per day is 4 classes * 60 minutes/class = 240 minutes.

2. **Calculate weekly extra class time:** Thiago attends these extra classes for 5 days a week, so the total weekly extra class time is 240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes.

3. **Calculate total weekly extra learning time:** Thiago spends two-fifths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (2/5) * total weekly minutes on Saturday and (2/5) * total weekly minutes on Sunday. Let 'x' represent the total weekly learning minutes. Then he spends (2/5)x on Saturday and (2/5)x on Sunday, for a combined 4/5x on the weekend.

4. **Formulate an equation for total weekly learning time:** The total weekly learning time 'x' consists of the extra class time plus the time spent on weekend learning. Thus, x = 1200 + (4/5)x.

5. **Solve for x:**
   x - (4/5)x = 1200
   (1/5)x = 1200
   x = 1200 * 5
   x = 6000 minutes

6. **Convert total weekly learning time to hours:**  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total weekly learning time in hours is 6000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 100 hours.

13,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Qasim has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 50 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends 1/6 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 6+3=9 classes a day
That means he spends 50*9=450 minutes per day in class
So he spends 450*4=1800 minutes a week
That means he spends 1800*1/6=300 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 1800+300+300=2400 minutes per week
So he spends 2400/60=40 hours per week
#### 40","
Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate daily class time:** A normal student has 6 periods a day. We don't know the length of each period, so we will assume each period is standard length of 50 minutes. Thus, Qasim goes to class 6 * 50 = 300 minutes per day.

2. **Calculate extra class time per day:** Qasim takes 3 extra classes, each 50 minutes long, so he has 3 * 50 = 150 minutes of extra classes per day.

3. **Calculate total daily learning time:** Qasim's total learning time each day is his regular class time plus his extra class time: 300 + 150 = 450 minutes.

4. **Calculate total weekly learning time from weekdays:** Qasim attends class for 4 days a week, learning 450 minutes each day, so he spends 4 * 450 = 1800 minutes learning on weekdays.

5. **Calculate total weekly learning time:** We know his weekly learning time is 1800 minutes, plus additional learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

6. **Calculate extra learning time per day on weekends:** He spends 1/6 of his weekly minutes on both Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, each weekend day he spends (1/6)*1800 / 2 = 150 minutes as extra learning time. (Dividing by 2 because it's split between Saturday and Sunday).

7. **Calculate total weekend learning time:** Qasim spends 150 minutes/day * 2 days = 300 minutes learning on weekends.

8. **Calculate total weekly learning time in minutes:** Adding the weekday and weekend learning time, Qasim learns for 1800 + 300 = 2100 minutes per week.

9. **Convert minutes to hours:** To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60: 2100 / 60 = 35 hours.

She had $1400 and spent $856 so she had $1400-$856 = $544 left over
#### 544","

Here's a breakdown of Quinn's spending and remaining money, using a chain of thought approach:

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 15 kg of saltwater taffy:** 15 kg * $23/kg = $345

2. **Calculate the discount on the 5 kg of saltwater taffy:** $23/kg * (1/4) = $5.75 discount per kg
   Total discount: 5 kg * $5.75/kg = $28.75

3. **Calculate the cost of the discounted 5 kg of saltwater taffy:** $23/kg * 5 kg = $115
   Price after discount: $115 - $28.75 = $86.25

4. **Calculate the total cost of the saltwater taffy:** $345 + $86.25 = $431.25

5. **Calculate the total cost of the keychains:** 17 keychains * $20.25/keychain = $344.25

6. **Calculate the total cost of all items:** $431.25 (taffy) + $11.50 (starfish) + $344.25 (keychains) = $787

7. **Calculate the remaining money:** $1400 (starting money) - $787 (total cost) = $613

15,There are 8 periods in the day for a normal student but Mohammed has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends one-seventh of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 8+3=11 classes a day

So he spends 385*4=1540 minutes a week
That means he spends 1540*1/7=220 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 1540+220+220=1980 minutes per week
So he spends 1980/60=33 hours per week
#### 33","
Here's the breakdown to calculate Mohammed's total weekly learning time:

1. **Calculate daily class time:** A normal student has 8 periods, and we assume each period is a standard length. We don't know the period length, so we'll need to infer it later. For now, focus on the extra classes. Mohammed has 3 extra classes * 35 minutes/class = 105 minutes of extra classes daily.

2. **Calculate total daily learning time (in minutes):** Let 'x' be the length of each normal period in minutes.  His total daily learning time is 8x + 105 minutes.

3. **Calculate daily learning time for 4 days:** He attends classes for 4 days, so his learning time for these days is 4 * (8x + 105) = 32x + 420 minutes.

4. **Calculate weekly learning time from Monday-Friday:** This is simply 32x + 420 minutes.

5. **Calculate extra learning time on Saturday & Sunday:**  One-seventh of his weekly minutes is spent on Saturday and one-seventh on Sunday.  So he spends 2/7 of his weekly learning time on the weekend.  Let 'W' be the total weekly learning time in minutes.  Then weekend learning time is (2/7) * W minutes.

6. **Formulate an equation for total weekly learning time:** The total weekly learning time (W) is the sum of Monday-Friday learning and weekend learning.  Therefore:
   W = (32x + 420) + (2/7)W

7. **Solve for W:**
   W - (2/7)W = 32x + 420
   (5/7)W = 32x + 420
   W = (7/5) * (32x + 420)
   W = (224/5)x + 588

8. **Infer the period length:** A standard school period is often 45-50 minutes. Let's assume a standard period length of 45 minutes (x = 45).

9. **Calculate weekly learning time with assumed period length:**
   W = (224/5) * 45 + 588
   W = 224 * 9 + 588
   W = 2016 + 588
   W = 2604 minutes

10. **Convert to hours:** Divide total minutes by 60 to get hours: 2604 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 43.4 hours.

Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:**
   Both complexes have 100 apartments each, so together they have 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.

2. **Calculate the size of the third complex:**
   The third complex is 20% bigger than the combined size of the first two. 20% of 200 is (20/100) * 200 = 40 apartments.  Therefore, the third complex has 200 + 40 = 240 apartments.

Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total space each flower takes up:** Each flower is 6 feet wide and needs 13 feet of space between it and the next. So, each flower takes up 6 + 13 = 19 feet of space.

2. **Determine the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed:**  Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each flower requires: 156 feet / 19 feet/flower = 8.21 flowers. Since Haruka can only have a whole number of flowers, she can fit 8 flowers in the flower bed.

3. **Calculate the number of flowers Haruka needs to buy:** Haruka wants a total of 8 flowers and already has 11.  However, since she can only fit 8, she *doesn't* need to buy any. In fact, she will have flowers left over. So the number of flowers she needs to buy is 8 - 11 = -3. This is a bit of a trick! We take the absolute value of this number, it means she doesn't need to buy *any* flowers. Or, more practically, she doesn't need to buy any and can even remove 3 flowers that she already owns!

Esteban bought 1610 popcorn because 1207.5 / 0.75 = 1610
#### 1610","
Here's a chain of thought to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the cost of the crackers:** Esteban bought 3 bags of crackers at 50 cents (¥50) each, so the crackers cost 3 * ¥50 = ¥150.

2. **Calculate the amount spent (before change):** Esteban started with ¥1300 and had 7% left over. This means he spent 100% - 7% = 93% of his money.

3. **Calculate the amount spent in yen:**  He spent 93% of ¥1300, which is 0.93 * ¥1300 = ¥1209.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on popcorn:** The total amount spent was ¥1209, and ¥150 was spent on crackers, so he spent ¥1209 - ¥150 = ¥1059 on popcorn.

5. **Calculate the number of popcorn bags:** Each bag of popcorn costs ¥75, so Esteban bought ¥1059 / ¥75 = 14.12 bags of popcorn.

6. **Consider the problem context.** He can only buy whole bags of popcorn, therefore we need to re-evaluate the whole problem.
7. **Calculate the change:** Esteban had 7% of ¥1300 left over, meaning he had 0.07 * ¥1300 = ¥91 left over.
8. **Calculate total spent:** Esteban spent ¥1300 - ¥91 = ¥1209.
9. **Calculate the amount spent on popcorn:** The total amount spent was ¥1209, and ¥150 was spent on crackers, so he spent ¥1209 - ¥150 = ¥1059 on popcorn.
10. **Calculate the number of popcorn bags:** Each bag of popcorn costs ¥75, so Esteban bought ¥1059 / ¥75 = 14.12 bags of popcorn.

Since Esteban can only buy a whole number of bags, the original information is slightly incorrect. Let's look at this from a set of equations.
Let x = the amount of crackers and y = the amount of popcorn.
0.50x + 0.75y = 1300 * 0.93 = 1209
x = 3
0.50(3) + 0.75y = 1209
1.5 + 0.75y = 1209
0.75y = 1207.5
y = 1207.5 / 0.75 = 1610

This is not possible as he only has 1300 * 0.93 = 1209 to spend.

Let's re-examine the problem. Maybe it's not ¥1300 but instead $1300.

If it's $1300
Crackers: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
Change: 7% of $1300 = $91
Spent: $1300 - $91 = $1209
Popcorn cost: $1209 - $1.50 = $1207.50
Popcorn bags: $1207.50 / $0.75 = 1610 bags!

Something is wrong with the problem setup. The number is far too high.

If it is yen (¥) instead of dollars ($), and the crackers are 50 yen and popcorn is 75 yen.
Crackers cost: 3 * 50 = 150 yen
Change: 7% of 1300 = 91 yen
Spent: 1300 - 91 = 1209 yen
Popcorn cost: 1209 - 150 = 1059 yen
Popcorn bags: 1059 / 75 = 14.12.
Since we must have a whole number of bags, the problem might be slightly off.
The closest whole number is 14.
Popcorn cost would be 14 * 75 = 1050 yen.
Total spent: 1050 + 150 = 1200.
Change: 1300 - 1200 = 100.
% change: 100 / 1300 = 7.69%

Assuming the 7% change is an approximation, Esteban bought 14 bags of popcorn.

23,"At Pavel's house, there are seven times as many bananas as grapes. He has a total of 34 grapes in his house. Pavel bought 53 more grapes at the store and 35 fewer bananas than the number of grapes. Find the combined total of the number of bananas and grapes Pavel has in the house?","Before buying any banana and grape, Pavel had 7 times as many bananas as grapes, which is 34 grapes * 7 banana/grape = 238 bananas
The total number of bananas and grapes that Pavel had before is 238 bananas + 34 grapes = 272 items
When he bought 35 fewer bananas than grapes, he bought 53 bananas - 35 bananas = 18 bananas
In total, he bought 18 bananas + 53 grapes = 71 items
After the purchases, Pavel has 272 items + 71 items = 343 total bananas and grapes combined.
#### 343","
Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the initial number of bananas:** Pavel has seven times as many bananas as grapes, and he initially has 34 grapes. So, the initial number of bananas is 7 * 34 = 238.

2. **Find the total number of grapes after buying more:** Pavel bought 53 more grapes, so the new total of grapes is 34 + 53 = 87 grapes.

3. **Find the number of bananas Pavel bought:** Pavel bought 35 fewer bananas than the number of grapes he *now* has. So, he bought 87 - 35 = 52 bananas.

4. **Find the new total number of bananas:** Pavel initially had 238 bananas and bought 52 more, so he now has 238 + 52 = 290 bananas.

5. **Calculate the combined total of bananas and grapes:** Pavel has 290 bananas and 87 grapes. The total is 290 + 87 = 377.

Valentina needs to buy 14 plants - 11 plants = 3 plants needed to purchase.
Valentina will spend 3 plants * €14 = €42.
#### 42","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies:** Each flower is 3 meters wide, and needs 15.5 meters of space after it, so each plant takes up 3 + 15.5 = 18.5 meters of space.

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed:** Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies: 217 meters / 18.5 meters/plant = 11.73 plants.  Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, round down to 11 plants that can fully fit. 

3. **Calculate how many more plants are needed:** Valentina already has 11 plants and can fit 11 more, so she needs 11 - 11 = 0 more plants.

4. **Calculate the total cost:** Since Valentina needs 0 more plants and each plant costs €14, the total cost is 0 plants * €14/plant = €0.

28,There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Ali has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends two-fourths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 5+3=8 classes a day
That means he spends 60*8=480 minutes per day in class
So he spends 480*4=1920 minutes a week
That means he spends 1920*1/2=960 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 1920+960+960=3840 minutes per week
So he spends 3840/60=64 hours per week
#### 64","
Here's a chain of thought to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate daily class time:** A normal student has 5 periods a day, and we assume each period is a standard length (though not specified, it is implicit in calculating extra time). Ali has 3 extra classes, each 60 minutes long, so his extra class time daily is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

2. **Calculate weekly extra class time:** He attends these extra classes 4 days a week, so his total weekly extra class time is 180 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 720 minutes.

3. **Calculate weekly extra learning time (Saturday):** He spends two-fourths (or 1/2) of his weekly minutes on Saturday. We need to find the value of 'weekly minutes' first.  Let 'x' be the total number of minutes in a week. Saturday's learning time is (1/2) * x.

4. **Calculate weekly extra learning time (Sunday):** He spends two-fourths (or 1/2) of his weekly minutes on Sunday. Sunday's learning time is also (1/2) * x.

5. **Total extra learning time equation:** The total weekly extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is (1/2)x + (1/2)x = x. This 'x' represents the total weekly minutes spent on extra learning. This total must be equivalent to the weekly extra class time computed in step 2.
Therefore x = 720 minutes.

6. **Calculate standard class time per week:** The problem states Ali goes to class for 4 days a week. However, it does not explicitly tell us the amount of time each normal class takes per day. We know Ali has 3 extra classes, but we don't know how many regular classes he has. Since it says 'normal student has 5 periods a day', we'll assume this is a standard.
We cannot determine how much time is spent on standard class time without knowing how long each period is. Since the focus is on *extra* learning time, let's focus solely on calculating the total learning time based on the information given about extra classes and extra learning time.

7. **Calculate total weekly learning time:**  Total learning time is weekly extra class time plus weekly extra learning time. This is 720 minutes + 720 minutes = 1440 minutes.

8. **Convert to hours:** To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60: 1440 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 24 hours.

Olga will spend 3 plants * ₺13 = ₺39.
#### 39","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total space needed for existing flowers:** Olga has 13 flowers, and each is 5 feet wide, so they take up 13 * 5 = 65 feet of space.

2. **Calculate the space needed for gaps between existing flowers:** There are 12 gaps between 13 flowers. Each gap is 12.5 feet, so the gaps take up 12 * 12.5 = 150 feet of space.

3. **Calculate the total space occupied by existing flowers and gaps:** The existing flowers and gaps take up 65 + 150 = 215 feet.

4. **Determine if the flower bed can accommodate all the flowers:** The flower bed is 200 feet long, and the existing flowers and gaps take up 215 feet. This is impossible, meaning either the gaps are smaller than stated/not all gaps are made or the length given is assuming the length is *just* for the flowers (without gaps) or the numbers in the question are incorrect. I will assume the length given needs to accommodate both flowers and gaps.

5. **Recalculate the total space needed for each flower (including gap):** Each flower is 5 feet wide and requires a 12.5-foot gap, for a combined space of 5 + 12.5 = 17.5 feet per flower.

6. **Calculate the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed:** The flower bed is 200 feet long, and each flower space requires 17.5 feet. Therefore, the flower bed can fit 200 / 17.5 = 11.42 flowers.  Since we can only have whole flowers, only 11 total flowers can fit in the flower bed.

7. **Calculate how many more flowers Olga needs to buy:** Olga already has 13 flowers, but only 11 can fit into the flower bed. This indicates there is information missing or contradictory in the initial problem. I will assume that Olga wants to fill the flower bed to capacity and we will proceed with the calculation.  Olga needs 11 -13 = -2 additional flowers. Since this would imply she already has more than needed, it's more accurate to say Olga has *too many* flowers to fit in the flower bed. I will assume she meant to fill it to capacity: 11 total flowers, she will need to remove 2 flowers. Thus, she needs to buy 0 flowers.

8. **Calculate the total cost:** Since Olga needs to buy 0 flowers, the cost will be 0 * ₺13 = ₺0.

Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the number of remaining pen pals:** Ravi started with 11 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 3, so he has 11 - 3 = 8 pen pals remaining.

2. **Calculate the total letters received per week:** Each of his 8 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so Ravi receives 8 * 2 = 16 letters per week.

3. **Calculate the total pages received per week:** Each letter is 9 pages long, so Ravi receives 16 * 9 = 144 pages of letters per week.

4. **Calculate the total letters Ravi sends per week:** Ravi responds to each letter he receives, so he sends 16 letters per week.

5. **Calculate the total pages Ravi sends per week:** Each of Ravi's letters is 9 pages long, so he sends 16 * 9 = 144 pages of letters per week.

6. **Calculate the total pages Ravi writes per week:** Ravi writes 144 pages to respond to his penpals and 144 pages from the letters he receives, for a total of 144 + 144 = 288 pages per week.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total space occupied by existing flowers:** Quinn has 13 flowers, and each is 5 meters wide, so they take up 13 flowers * 5 meters/flower = 65 meters.

2. **Calculate the remaining space in the flower bed:** The flower bed is 189 meters long, and 65 meters are occupied, leaving 189 meters - 65 meters = 124 meters of space.

3. **Calculate the number of gaps between plants:**  To find out how many plants can fit in the remaining space, we will consider the space needed for each plant plus the gap between them. The combined space for one plant and its gap is 5 meters (plant width) + 13.5 meters (gap) = 18.5 meters.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants that can fit:** Dividing the remaining space by the combined space per plant/gap gives us the number of additional plants that can fit: 124 meters / 18.5 meters/plant = 6.69 plants. Since we can only purchase whole plants, we can fit 6 additional plants.

5. **Calculate the total number of plants needed:** Quinn already has 13 plants and will buy 6 more, for a total of 13 plants + 6 plants = 19 plants.

Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total space each plant takes up:** Each plant is 2 meters wide, and has 13.5 meters of space between it and the next plant, so each plant occupies 2 + 13.5 = 15.5 meters of the flower bed.

2. **Calculate the number of plants the flower bed can hold:** The flower bed is 162 meters long. Divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies: 162 / 15.5 = 10.45 plants. Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 10 plants.

3. **Calculate the number of plants Rania needs to buy:** Rania already has 11 plants and only needs to fit 10 plants in the flower bed. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any plants.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of bumper cars:** Leilani wants to ride the bumper cars 4 times at $10 per ride, so the bumper cars will cost 4 * $10 = $40.

2. **Calculate the cost of game room tokens:** She wants $8 in game room tokens for everyone, including herself. We don't yet know how many people there are total, so we'll represent the number of people as 'x'. The total cost of tokens will then be $8 * x.

3. **Calculate the cost of bowling:** Similarly, bowling costs $7 per person, so the total bowling cost will be $7 * x.

4. **Set up an equation:** The total cost of the party (bowling + bumper cars + tokens) must be less than or equal to her budget of $220. This can be represented by the equation: $7x + $40 + $8x <= $220.

5. **Combine like terms:**  Combine the 'x' terms in the equation: 15x + $40 <= $220.

6. **Subtract $40 from both sides:** Subtract $40 from both sides of the inequality to isolate the 'x' term: 15x <= $180.

7. **Divide both sides by 15:** Divide both sides by 15 to solve for 'x': x <= 12.

8. **Interpret the result:** 'x' represents the total number of people at the party (Leilani plus her friends). Since x must be a whole number, Leilani can invite a maximum of 12 people in total.

That means he spends 1080*1/2=540 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 1080+540+540=2160 minutes per week
So he spends 2160/60=36 hours per week
#### 36","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate daily class time (regular classes):** A normal student has 5 periods a day, but the problem doesn't state the duration of each period. We'll assume each period is a standard length and focus on *additional* class time. Thus, we can ignore this information.

2. **Calculate daily extra class time:** Viktor has 4 extra classes, each 30 minutes long, so he spends 4 * 30 = 120 minutes on extra classes daily.

3. **Convert daily extra class time to hours:** 120 minutes is equal to 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

4. **Calculate weekly extra class time:** He takes these extra classes for 4 days a week, so his weekly extra class time is 2 hours/day * 4 days/week = 8 hours/week.

5. **Calculate total weekly extra learning time:** He spends one-half of his weekly minutes total on Saturday and one-half on Sunday. The problem implies that this refers to the total learning minutes, so the learning time from the 4 extra classes makes up one component. Let 'x' be the total minutes spent learning per week. The extra learning time on Saturday is x/2 and Sunday is x/2. However, we need to derive x first.

6. **Calculate total weekly minutes learning from extra classes:**  Since the extra class time is 8 hours per week, and we convert to minutes, this is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

7. **Define Total Learning Time (x):**  The 480 minutes of extra classes represents a portion of his overall learning time. We know the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday each equate to half of the total learning time 'x'. So the total weekly learning time can be described as: x = 480 + x/2 + x/2 = x. This seems circular. Instead, the extra learning time is *in addition to* the 480 minutes from the extra classes. Let's rethink.

8. **Reinterpret 'one-half of weekly minutes':** The problem states Viktor spends ""one-half of his weekly minutes"" on Saturday and one-half on Sunday as *extra* learning time. This is in addition to the minutes he spends on extra classes. This means, the total extra learning time each day is equivalent to the amount of learning time he spends in his extra classes.  So extra learning time on Saturday = 480 minutes.  And extra learning time on Sunday = 480 minutes.

9. **Calculate total weekly extra learning time (Saturday and Sunday):** His total extra learning time on the weekend is 480 minutes/day * 2 days = 960 minutes.

10. **Calculate total weekly learning time (in minutes):**  Total weekly learning time = (extra classes) + (Saturday extra learning) + (Sunday extra learning) = 480 + 960 = 1440 minutes.

11. **Convert total weekly learning time to hours:** 1440 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 24 hours.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of roller coaster rides:** Uma wants to ride the roller coaster 10 times at ¥10 per ride, so the total cost for the roller coaster is 10 * ¥10 = ¥100.

2. **Calculate the total cost of pinball tokens:** Uma wants ¥10 in pinball tokens for everyone, including herself. So, we'll represent the total number of people as 'x' (Uma + her friends), and the pinball tokens will cost 10x.

3. **Calculate the cost of laser tag:** A round of laser tag is ¥10 per person, so the laser tag cost will also be 10x.

4. **Set up an equation for the total cost:** The total cost of the party (laser tag + pinball + roller coaster) must be less than or equal to the budget of ¥240. So the equation is: 10x + 10x + ¥100 = ¥240

5. **Simplify the equation:** Combine the 'x' terms: 20x + ¥100 = ¥240

6. **Solve for x:**  Subtract ¥100 from both sides: 20x = ¥140.  Then divide both sides by 20: x = 7.

7. **Determine the number of friends:** Since 'x' represents the total number of people (Uma plus her friends), and we know Uma is one person, the number of friends is 7 - 1 = 6.

43,"At Bodhi's house, there are six times as many persimmons as oranges. He has a total of 73 oranges in his house. Bodhi bought 60 more oranges at the store and 35 fewer persimmons than the number of oranges. Find the combined total of the number of persimmons and oranges Bodhi has in the house?","Before buying any persimmon and orange, Bodhi had 6 times as many persimmons as oranges, which is 73 oranges * 6 persimmon/orange = 438 persimmons
The total number of persimmons and oranges that Bodhi had before is 438 persimmons + 73 oranges = 511 items
When he bought 35 fewer persimmons than oranges, he bought 60 persimmons - 35 persimmons = 25 persimmons
In total, he bought 25 persimmons + 60 oranges = 85 items
After the purchases, Bodhi has 511 items + 85 items = 596 total persimmons and oranges combined.
#### 596","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of persimmons:** Bodhi initially has six times as many persimmons as oranges, and he has 73 oranges.  So, he has 6 * 73 = 438 persimmons.

2. **New number of oranges:** Bodhi buys 60 more oranges, so he now has 73 + 60 = 133 oranges.

3. **Number of persimmons bought/removed:** Bodhi buys 35 *fewer* persimmons than the *new* number of oranges. The new number of oranges is 133, so he buys 133 - 35 = 98 persimmons. Since the problem states 'fewer', this implies he *removes* 35 persimmons. Therefore, he now has 438 - 35 = 403 persimmons. Also we can interpret it as if he had intended to buy 35 persimmons as well but he didn't. That's not something that changes the amount of persimmons he has, he still has 438 - 35 = 403

4. **Combined total:**  The combined total of persimmons and oranges is now 403 + 133 = 536.

44,There are 9 periods in the day for a normal student but Arash has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 45 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends one-sixth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 9+3=12 classes a day
That means he spends 45*12=540 minutes per day in class
So he spends 540*6=3240 minutes a week
That means he spends 3240*1/6=540 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 3240+540+540=4320 minutes per week
So he spends 4320/60=72 hours per week
#### 72","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total minutes in a normal school day:** A normal day has 9 periods, and assuming each period is an hour (60 minutes), the normal school day is 9 periods * 60 minutes/period = 540 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total extra class time per day:** Arash takes 3 extra classes, each 45 minutes long, so his extra class time is 3 classes * 45 minutes/class = 135 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total class time per day:** Arash's total class time each day is his normal time plus his extra time: 540 minutes + 135 minutes = 675 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total weekly class time (Monday-Friday):** He attends class for 6 days a week, so his weekly class time is 675 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 4050 minutes.

5. **Calculate the extra learning time per day on the weekend:** Arash spends one-sixth of his weekly minutes on each weekend day. We need to determine what weekly minutes is referring to. It's most likely referring to the weekly class time we calculated in step 4. So, the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is 4050 minutes / 6 = 675 minutes per day.

6. **Calculate the total weekend learning time:**  He has two weekend days, so his total weekend learning time is 675 minutes/day * 2 days = 1350 minutes.

7. **Calculate total weekly learning time in minutes:**  Add the weekday class time to the weekend learning time: 4050 minutes + 1350 minutes = 5400 minutes.

8. **Convert the total weekly learning time to hours:** Divide the total minutes by 60 minutes/hour: 5400 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 90 hours.

How much money does he make in a week?,"The first 4 complexes have 4*250=1000 apartments
The 5th one has 1000*0.5=500 more apartments than those 4 combined. So it has 1000+500=1500 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 1500+1000=2500 apartments each time
That means he visits 2500*2=5000 apartments every week
So he makes 5000*₺0.45=₺2250 every week
#### 2250","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total apartments in the first 4 complexes:** 4 complexes * 250 apartments/complex = 1000 apartments.

2. **Calculate the size of the last complex:** The last complex is 50% bigger than the combined size of the first 4, so it's 1000 apartments * 0.50 = 500 apartments bigger, making it 1000 + 500 = 1500 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments:** Total apartments = apartments in first 4 + apartments in last complex = 1000 + 1500 = 2500 apartments.

4. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:** Faisal collects garbage 2 times a week from each of the 5 complexes, so he makes 5 complexes * 2 collections/complex = 10 collections per week.

5. **Calculate the total number of apartment collections per week:** Faisal collects from 2500 apartments, and does this 10 times per week: 2500 apartments * 10 collections = 25,000 collections per week

#### 464","
Here's a breakdown of Chen's spending, step-by-step, to determine how much money she has left:

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 17 kgs of cotton candy:** 17 kg * $21/kg = $357

2. **Calculate the discount on the additional cotton candy:** Chen bought 23 kg total, so she got 23 kg - 17 kg = 6 kg at a discount.  The discounted amount is 4 kg at 1/3 off, so she got 4 kgs * (1/3 * $21/kg) = 4 * $7 = $28 off. Since she bought 6 kgs, of which 4 kgs were 1/3 off, and the remainder 2 kg were at full price, we calculate: 4 * $21/kg * (2/3) + 2 * $21/kg = $28 + $42 = $70 for the remaining 2kgs.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the cotton candy**: $357 (for the first 17 kgs) + $70 (for the remaining 6 kgs, of which 4 are discounted) = $427

4. **Calculate the total cost of the pins:** 13 pins * $20.75/pin = $269.75

5. **Calculate Chen's total spending:** $427 (cotton candy) + $11.25 (coral) + $269.75 (pins) = $708

Here's a chain of thought to solve the problem:

1. **Initial number of grapes:** Xavier has seven times as many grapes as kiwis, and he starts with 38 kiwis. Therefore, he initially has 7 * 38 = 266 grapes.

2. **Total kiwis after buying more:** Xavier buys 61 more kiwis, so he now has 38 + 61 = 99 kiwis.

3. **Number of grapes bought:** Xavier bought 30 fewer grapes than the *new* number of kiwis. So, he bought 99 - 30 = 69 grapes.

4. **Total grapes after buying more:** Xavier initially had 266 grapes and bought 69 more, giving him a total of 266 + 69 = 335 grapes.

She can invite 1 friends because 2 - 1 =1
#### 1","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the roller coaster rides:** Sofia wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times at $11 per ride, so the total cost is 8 * $11 = $88.

2. **Calculate the cost of pinball tokens:** Sofia wants $6 in pinball tokens for herself and each friend.  Let 'f' be the number of friends she invites. The total cost of pinball tokens will be 6 * (f + 1) = $6f + $6.

3. **Calculate the cost of laser tag:** Sofia and her friends all want to play one round of laser tag at $6 per person.  The total cost of laser tag will be $6 * (f + 1) = $6f + $6.

4. **Determine the total cost of the party:** The total cost is the sum of the roller coaster rides, pinball tokens, and laser tag: $88 + ($6f + $6) + ($6f + $6) = $88 + $12f + $12 = $100 + $12f.

5. **Set up an equation for the budget:** Sofia’s mom budgeted $200 for the party. We can write the equation: $100 + $12f = $200.

6. **Solve for the number of friends (f):**
   * Subtract $100 from both sides of the equation: $12f = $100
   * Divide both sides by $12: f = $100 / $12 = 8.333...

7. **Round down to the nearest whole number:** Since Sofia can't invite a fraction of a friend, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Sofia can invite 8 friends.

After the purchases, Benjamin has 260 items + 111 items = 371 total figs and apples combined.
#### 371","
Here's a chain of thought to solve the problem:

1. **Initial number of figs:** We know there are four times as many figs as apples *initially*. Benjamin has 52 apples initially. So, the initial number of figs is 4 * 52 = 208 figs.

2. **New number of apples:** Benjamin buys 63 more apples, so his total number of apples becomes 52 + 63 = 115 apples.

3. **Number of new figs:** He buys 15 *fewer* figs than the *new* number of apples. This means he buys 115 - 15 = 100 figs.

4. **New total number of figs:** The initial number of figs were 208 and he bought 100 more, so now he has 208 + 100 = 308 figs.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of pebbles dropped:** Oscar dropped 1/3 of his 72 pebbles, so he dropped (1/3) * 72 = 24 pebbles.

2. **Calculate the number of pebbles remaining after the fall:** He started with 72 and dropped 24, leaving him with 72 - 24 = 48 pebbles.

3. **Calculate the number of pebbles still missing:** He found 17 of the 24 dropped pebbles, meaning 24 - 17 = 7 pebbles are still missing.

4. **Calculate the number of pebbles Oscar has before identifying the coins:** Oscar has the original remaining pebbles (48) minus the ones that are still missing (7), so he has 48 - 7 = 41 pebbles.

Leon bought 654 gum because 490.5 / 0.75 = 654
#### 654","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the change:** Leon had 1% of his ¥500 left as change.  1% of ¥500 is (1/100) * ¥500 = ¥5.

2. **Calculate the amount spent:** Leon spent ¥500 - ¥5 = ¥495 on popcorn and gum.

3. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn:** He bought 9 bags of popcorn at 50 cents (¥50) each, so he spent 9 * ¥50 = ¥450 on popcorn.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on gum:**  Leon spent ¥495 total and ¥450 on popcorn, so he spent ¥495 - ¥450 = ¥45 on gum.

5. **Calculate the number of gum bought:** Each piece of gum cost ¥75. Therefore, he bought ¥45 / ¥75 = 0.6 pieces of gum.

6. **Re-examine the problem**: Given the answer from step 5 is not a whole number, we must reconsider the currency for popcorn. Popcorn is sold for 50 cents, and the entire problem operates in yen. It is more reasonable to assume that the 50 cents refers to 50 yen. 

7. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn (revised):** He bought 9 bags of popcorn at ¥50 each, so he spent 9 * ¥50 = ¥450 on popcorn.

8. **Calculate the amount spent on gum (revised):**  Leon spent ¥495 total and ¥450 on popcorn, so he spent ¥495 - ¥450 = ¥45 on gum.

9. **Calculate the number of gum bought (revised):** Each piece of gum cost ¥75. Therefore, he bought ¥45 / ¥75 = 0.6 pieces of gum.

10. **Re-examine the problem again**: The answer is still not a whole number, so the error must stem from how we interpret ""50 cents."" It is more reasonable to assume the cost of popcorn is ¥0.50. 

11. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn (revised):** He bought 9 bags of popcorn at ¥0.50 each, so he spent 9 * ¥0.50 = ¥4.50 on popcorn.

12. **Calculate the amount spent on gum (revised):** Leon spent ¥500 - ¥5 = ¥495 total.  The cost of popcorn is ¥4.50, meaning he spent ¥495 - ¥4.5 = ¥490.50 on gum.

13. **Calculate the number of gum bought (revised):** Each piece of gum costs ¥75. Therefore, he bought ¥490.50 / ¥75 = 6.54 pieces of gum.

14. **Re-examine the problem one last time**: The answer is still not a whole number. There is an error in the original problem. However, the closest to a whole number appears to be 6, using approximate numbers.

15. **Test the closest whole number**: If Leon purchased 6 pieces of gum, the amount he spent on gum is ¥75 * 6 = ¥450. Then, the total spent on popcorn and gum is ¥450 + ¥450 = ¥900, which is much more than ¥495. So this won't work.

16. **Consider a rounding error:** Perhaps the change of ¥5 is approximation. However, assuming 1% of ¥500 is exactly ¥5 allows us to attempt to solve the proportions.

17. **Back to the assumption that popcorn is ¥50:** Let x be the number of gums. Then, 9*50 + 75*x = 500 - 5 =495. 450 + 75x = 495. 75x = 45. x = 45/75 = 0.6. This assumption doesn't work.

18. **Back to the assumption that popcorn is ¥0.50**: Let x be the number of gums. Then, 9*0.50 + 75*x = 500 - 5 = 495. 4.5 + 75x = 495. 75x = 490.5. x = 490.5/75 = 6.54. This assumption doesn't work.

Since we cannot arrive at a whole number answer. We will re-interpret the 50cents and 75cents as US cents. and Convert it to Yen to proceed.

19. **Convert cents to Yen:** Assuming 1 USD = 150 Yen, 50 cents is ¥75 and 75 cents is roughly ¥112.5.

20. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn:** He bought 9 bags of popcorn at ¥75 each, so he spent 9 * ¥75 = ¥675 on popcorn. This is impossible because it exceeds ¥500.

21. **There is an error in the given problem**. Since we can't reconcile the numbers to a whole number of gums, we will revisit the most logical interpretation from the initial assumptions. Despite repeated attempts it seems the question itself contains an error.

It is probable the 50 cents should be understood as JPY 50.
So with this logic, it seems a mistake was made in the problem, therefore the assumptions made throughout led to an impossible answer.

Here's a chain of thought to solve the problem:

1. **Initial number of plums:** Faisal had five times as many plums as grapes, and he initially had 86 grapes. So, the number of plums initially was 5 * 86 = 430 plums.

2. **New number of grapes:** Faisal bought 78 more grapes. So, the new total of grapes is 86 + 78 = 164 grapes.

3. **Number of plums bought:** Faisal bought 32 fewer plums than the *number of grapes* (new number). So, he bought 164 - 32 = 132 plums.

How old was Gabriel when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Gabriel saw the Comet for the second time when he was 44 years * 2= 88 years old.
Comet Halley can be seen every 80 years, so Gabriel saw the comet for the first time when he was 88 years - 80 years = 8 years old.
#### 8","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine when the comet was visible the second time.** Since the comet orbits every 80 years, the second time Gabriel's dad saw it was 80 years after the first time.

2. **Calculate Gabriel's dad's age the second time he saw the comet.**  His dad was 44 the first time and 80 years later, he would be 44 + 80 = 124 years old.

3. **Calculate Gabriel's age the second time he saw the comet.** Gabriel was twice his dad's age at that time, so Gabriel was 2 * 124 = 248 years old.

4. **Determine the time difference between Gabriel's second and first sighting.** The comet appears every 80 years, and Gabriel saw it twice. The time between the sightings must be a multiple of 80 years.

5. **Calculate Gabriel's age when he first saw the comet.** Since Gabriel was 248 when he saw it the second time, and the comet appeared 80 years earlier, his age the first time he saw the comet was 248 - 80 = 168 years old.

49,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Faisal has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 30 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends one-eighth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 6+2=8 classes a day
That means he spends 30*8=240 minutes per day in class

That means he spends 960*1/8=120 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 960+120+120=1200 minutes per week
So he spends 1200/60=20 hours per week
#### 20","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate daily class time:** A normal student has 6 periods, and each period is assumed to be a standard length (typically 45-50 minutes). However, the problem doesn't state the period length, and focuses solely on the extra classes. So we focus on Faisal’s additional class time. He takes 2 extra classes, each 30 minutes long, so he spends 2 * 30 = 60 minutes in extra classes daily.

2. **Calculate total daily learning time:**  Faisal attends those extra classes every day for 4 days a week. The normal classes are not mentioned as a time factor, so his daily learning time is the time in extra classes, which is 60 minutes.

3. **Calculate total weekly learning time from classes:** He spends 60 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 240 minutes per week in extra classes.

4. **Calculate extra learning time on weekends:** He spends one-eighth of his weekly total from classes on Saturday, and another one-eighth on Sunday.  So total extra weekend time is (1/8 * 240) + (1/8 * 240) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

5. **Calculate total weekly learning time:** His total weekly learning time is the time from extra classes plus the weekend study time: 240 minutes + 60 minutes = 300 minutes.

43,"At Bodhi's house, there are six times as many persimmons as oranges. He has a total of 73 oranges in his house. Bodhi bought 60 more oranges at the store and 35 fewer persimmons than the number of oranges. Find the combined total of the number of persimmons and oranges Bodhi has in the house?","Before buying any persimmon and orange, Bodhi had 6 times as many persimmons as oranges, which is 73 oranges * 6 persimmon/orange = 438 persimmons
The total number of persimmons and oranges that Bodhi had before is 438 persimmons + 73 oranges = 511 items
When he bought 35 fewer persimmons than oranges, he bought 60 persimmons - 35 persimmons = 25 persimmons
In total, he bought 25 persimmons + 60 oranges = 85 items
After the purchases, Bodhi has 511 items + 85 items = 596 total persimmons and oranges combined.
#### 596","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of persimmons:** Bodhi initially has six times as many persimmons as oranges, and he has 73 oranges.  So, he has 6 * 73 = 438 persimmons.

2. **New number of oranges:** Bodhi buys 60 more oranges, so he now has 73 + 60 = 133 oranges.

3. **Number of persimmons bought/removed:** Bodhi buys 35 *fewer* persimmons than the *new* number of oranges. The new number of oranges is 133, so he buys 133 - 35 = 98 persimmons. Since the problem states 'fewer', this implies he *removes* 35 persimmons. Therefore, he now has 438 - 35 = 403 persimmons. Also we can interpret it as if he had intended to buy 35 persimmons as well but he didn't. That's not something that changes the amount of persimmons he has, he still has 438 - 35 = 403

4. **Combined total:**  The combined total of persimmons and oranges is now 403 + 133 = 536.

44,There are 9 periods in the day for a normal student but Arash has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 45 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends one-sixth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 9+3=12 classes a day
That means he spends 45*12=540 minutes per day in class
So he spends 540*6=3240 minutes a week
That means he spends 3240*1/6=540 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 3240+540+540=4320 minutes per week
So he spends 4320/60=72 hours per week
#### 72","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total minutes in a normal school day:** A normal day has 9 periods, and assuming each period is an hour (60 minutes), the normal school day is 9 periods * 60 minutes/period = 540 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total extra class time per day:** Arash takes 3 extra classes, each 45 minutes long, so his extra class time is 3 classes * 45 minutes/class = 135 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total class time per day:** Arash's total class time each day is his normal time plus his extra time: 540 minutes + 135 minutes = 675 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total weekly class time (Monday-Friday):** He attends class for 6 days a week, so his weekly class time is 675 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 4050 minutes.

5. **Calculate the extra learning time per day on the weekend:** Arash spends one-sixth of his weekly minutes on each weekend day. We need to determine what weekly minutes is referring to. It's most likely referring to the weekly class time we calculated in step 4. So, the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is 4050 minutes / 6 = 675 minutes per day.

6. **Calculate the total weekend learning time:**  He has two weekend days, so his total weekend learning time is 675 minutes/day * 2 days = 1350 minutes.

7. **Calculate total weekly learning time in minutes:**  Add the weekday class time to the weekend learning time: 4050 minutes + 1350 minutes = 5400 minutes.

8. **Convert the total weekly learning time to hours:** Divide the total minutes by 60 minutes/hour: 5400 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 90 hours.

So he makes 5000*₺0.45=₺2250 every week
#### 2250","
Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the total apartments in the first 4 complexes:** 4 complexes * 250 apartments/complex = 1000 apartments.

2. **Calculate the size of the last complex:** The last complex is 50% bigger than the combined size of the first 4, so it's 1000 apartments * 0.50 = 500 apartments bigger, making it 1000 + 500 = 1500 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments:** Total apartments = apartments in first 4 + apartments in last complex = 1000 + 1500 = 2500 apartments.

4. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:** Faisal collects garbage 2 times a week from each of the 5 complexes, so he makes 5 complexes * 2 collections/complex = 10 collections per week.

5. **Calculate the total number of apartment collections per week:** Faisal collects from 2500 apartments, and does this 10 times per week: 2500 apartments * 10 collections = 25,000 collections per week

6. **Calculate the total payment per week:** Faisal gets paid ₺0.45 per collection, and has 25,000 collections per week, so he makes ₺0.45/collection * 25,000 collections = ₺11,250.

She can invite 7 friends because 8 - 1 =7
#### 7","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the roller coaster rides:** Tara wants to ride the roller coaster 4 times at ₣5 per ride, so the total cost for the roller coaster is 4 * ₣5 = ₣20.

2. **Calculate the total cost per person (excluding laser tag):** Each person gets ₣5 in pinball tokens and rides the roller coaster for ₣20.  So the cost per person is ₣5 + ₣20 = ₣25.

3. **Calculate the cost of laser tag for everyone:** A round of laser tag costs ₣10.  This cost applies to Tara *and* all of her friends.

4. **Calculate the remaining budget after laser tag:** Tara starts with ₣280 and spends ₣10 on laser tag, leaving ₣280 - ₣10 = ₣270.

5. **Determine how much money is available for friends' activities:** The ₣270 is used for the pinball and roller coaster rides of Tara and her friends.

6. **Let 'x' represent the number of friends:** This means there are a total of x + 1 people (Tara plus her friends) who will be enjoying pinball and rides.

7. **Set up an equation to represent the total cost:** The cost of pinball and rollercoasters for x+1 people is ₣25 * (x + 1). We know that this cost must be less than or equal to the remaining budget of ₣270. So, 25 * (x + 1) ≤ 270

8. **Solve the equation for x:**
   * 25x + 25 ≤ 270
   * 25x ≤ 270 - 25
   * 25x ≤ 245
   * x ≤ 245 / 25

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes:**
   Each of the first 3 complexes has 300 apartments, so together they have 3 * 300 = 900 apartments.

2. **Calculate the size of the fourth complex:**
   The fourth complex is 35% bigger than the first 3 combined (900 apartments). 
   35% of 900 is (35/100) * 900 = 315 apartments.
   So the fourth complex has 900 + 315 = 1215 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments across all complexes:**
   The total number of apartments is 900 + 1215 = 2115 apartments.

4. **Calculate the number of collections per week:**
   Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each of the 4 complexes, so there are 3 * 4 = 12 collections per week.

So he spends 2970+1485+1485=5940 minutes per week
So he spends 5940/60=99 hours per week
#### 99","
Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate daily class time:** A normal student has 6 periods a day. Let's assume each period is a standard length, which is commonly 45-50 minutes. Without that info, we'll work with Umar's extra classes primarily. Umar has 3 extra classes * 55 minutes/class = 165 minutes of extra class time daily.

2. **Calculate total weekday learning time:** Umar goes to class 6 days a week.  His total extra learning time is 165 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 990 minutes per week. We will assume a normal day of classes amounts to around 300 minutes (6 x 50 minutes). His total weekday learning time is then 300 minutes/day * 6 days/week + 990 minutes = 1800 + 990 = 2790 minutes. 

3. **Calculate weekend learning time per day:** Umar spends one-half of his total weekly minutes on Saturday and one-half on Sunday. Total weekly time is 2790. Therefore, Saturday learning time is 2790 minutes / 2 = 1395 minutes and Sunday learning time is 2790 minutes / 2 = 1395 minutes.

4. **Calculate total weekly learning time in minutes:**  Total weekly learning time = weekday learning time + Saturday learning time + Sunday learning time = 2790 + 1395+ 1395 = 5580 minutes.

5. **Convert total weekly learning time to hours:** Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,  total weekly learning time in hours is 5580 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 93 hours.

Kimia needs to buy 12 plants - 11 plants = 1 plants needed to purchase.
Kimia will spend 1 plants * ¥14 = ¥14.
#### 14","
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total space occupied by existing flowers:** Kimia has 11 flowers, and each is 6 feet wide. So, the existing flowers occupy 11 * 6 = 66 feet.

2. **Calculate the remaining space in the flower bed:** The flower bed is 210 feet long, and 66 feet are already occupied. Therefore, the remaining space is 210 - 66 = 144 feet.

3. **Calculate the space occupied by gaps between plants:**  Let 'n' be the number of additional plants needed. The total space occupied by gaps between plants will be (n+1) * 17.5 feet (We add 1 to n because the gaps are between plants, meaning there's a gap *after* the last plant as well).

4. **Calculate the total space occupied by the new plants:** Each new plant takes up 6 feet, so n new plants will take up 6n feet.

5. **Set up an equation to represent the remaining space:** The remaining space (144 feet) must equal the total space taken up by the gaps and the new plants.  So, 6n + (n+1) * 17.5 = 144.

6. **Solve the equation for n:**
   6n + 17.5n + 17.5 = 144
   23.5n = 144 - 17.5
   23.5n = 126.5
   n = 126.5 / 23.5
   n = 5.38  Since we can't buy a fraction of a plant, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6.

7. **Calculate the cost of the new plants:** Kimia needs to buy 6 plants, and each plant costs ¥14. So, the total cost will be 6 * 14 = ¥84.

Here's a chain of thought to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate daily class time:** A normal student has 5 periods per day. Let's assume each period is a standard length, but it's not given, so we'll need to consider the extra classes first.

2. **Calculate total extra class time per day:** Arash takes 4 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, so his extra class time is 4 * 40 = 160 minutes per day.

3. **Calculate total weekly extra class time:** He takes these extra classes 4 days a week, so his total extra class time per week is 160 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 640 minutes.

4. **Estimate daily regular class time:**  We need to determine the total time spent in regular classes per week. A typical school day might be around 6-8 hours or 360-480 minutes. Let's take an average of 420 minutes per day for regular classes. 

5. **Calculate total weekly regular class time:**  He has regular classes 4 days a week, so his total regular class time is 420 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 1680 minutes.

6. **Calculate total weekly class time (regular + extra):**  His total class time (regular plus extra) is 1680 minutes + 640 minutes = 2320 minutes.

7. **Calculate extra learning time on Saturday:** He spends 1/6 of his total weekly minutes on Saturday. Total weekly minutes are 7 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes. So, Saturday's extra learning time is (1/6) * 10080 = 1680 minutes.

8. **Calculate extra learning time on Sunday:**  Similarly, his Sunday extra learning time is also 1/6 of the total weekly minutes, which is also 1680 minutes.

9. **Calculate total weekly extra learning time:**  His total extra learning time on the weekend is 1680 minutes + 1680 minutes = 3360 minutes.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of current pen pals:** Oscar started with 11 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 3, so he has 11 - 3 = 8 pen pals.

2. **Calculate letters received per week:** Each of his 8 pen pals sends 3 letters a week, so he receives 8 * 3 = 24 letters per week.

3. **Calculate total pages received per week:** Each letter is 5 pages long, so he receives 24 * 5 = 120 pages of letters per week.

4. **Calculate letters sent per week:** Oscar responds to each letter he receives, so he also sends 24 letters per week.

5. **Calculate total pages sent per week:** Oscar also writes letters that are 5 pages each, thus Oscar sends 24 * 5 = 120 pages of letters per week.

6. **Calculate total pages written per week:**  Oscar reads 120 pages and writes 120 pages, for a total of 120 + 120 = 240 pages per week.

7. **Calculate total minutes spent writing per week:** Oscar writes 1 page every 13 minutes, so he spends 240 * 13 = 3120 minutes writing per week.
