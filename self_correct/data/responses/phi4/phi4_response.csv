0,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 175 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 1975 and you have already consumed 925 calories?","If the total calorie target is 1975 and I have consumed 925 calories then I have 1975-925 = 1050 calories left to eat
If each serving of breads has 175 calories and I only have 1050 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1050/175 of a serving = 6 of a serving
We also know that a 300 ounces bag of breads has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 ounces/5 = 60 ounces
If I can only eat 6 of a serving, then I can eat only 60 * 6 = 60*6 = 360 ounces
#### 360","To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the remaining calorie allowance:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 1975 calories.
   - You have already consumed 925 calories.
   - Remaining calorie allowance = 1975 calories - 925 calories = 1050 calories.

2. **Determine the calories per serving of bread:**
   - According to the nutritional info, one serving of bread contains 175 calories.

3. **Calculate the number of servings you can consume with the remaining calorie allowance:**
   - Number of servings you can consume = Remaining calorie allowance / Calories per serving
   - Number of servings = 1050 calories / 175 calories per serving = 6 servings.

4. **Determine how much of the bread is used per serving:**
   - The 300-ounce bag has 5 servings.
   - Ounces per serving = Total ounces / Number of servings
   - Ounces per serving = 300 ounces / 5 servings = 60 ounces per serving.

5. **Calculate the total ounces you can consume:**
   - Since you can consume 6 servings and each serving is 60 ounces:
   - Total ounces you can eat = Number of servings you can consume * Ounces per serving
   - Total ounces = 6 servings * 60 ounces per serving = 360 ounces.

6. **Check if the limit of the bag allows for this consumption:**
   - The bag contains only 300 ounces, but you calculated 360 ounces, which implies you can only consume as much as the bag allows.

7. **Determine the actual ounces you can consume from the bag:**
   - Since the bag contains only 300 ounces, the maximum ounces you can actually consume from the bag, even if you could consume more servings calorie-wise, is 300 ounces.

Answer: 300 ounces",300
1,Theo hires a party bus from 3 PM to 8 PM. He gets 2 hours free. The first paid hour is $24 and each hour after that is twice the cost. How much did he pay?,"He got it for 8-3=5 hours
He pays for 5-2=3 hours
The first hour cost 1*24=$24
The other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive
They cost 24*2=$48 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*48=$96
So he pays 96+24=$120
#### 120","To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps and calculate the total cost for Theo's party bus rental.

1. **Determine the Total Duration:**
   - Theo hires the party bus from 3 PM to 8 PM.
   - Total time = 8 PM - 3 PM = 5 hours.

2. **Identify the Free Hours:**
   - Theo gets 2 hours free. 

3. **Calculate the Paid Hours:**
   - Total rented hours = 5 hours.
   - Free hours = 2 hours.
   - Paid hours = Total rented hours - Free hours = 5 hours - 2 hours = 3 hours.

4. **Determine the Cost for Each Paid Hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $24.
   - Each subsequent paid hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.

5. **Calculate the Cost for Each Paid Hour:**
   - First paid hour: $24.
   - Second paid hour: 2 × $24 = $48.
   - Third paid hour: 2 × $48 = $96.

6. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of first paid hour + Cost of second paid hour + Cost of third paid hour.
   - Total cost = $24 + $48 + $96.

7. **Perform the Addition:**
   - $24 + $48 = $72.
   - $72 + $96 = $168.

Therefore, Theo paid a total of $168 for the party bus rental.

2,"Ali caught 6 trouts last Wednesday, the first trout he caught weighs 51 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 45 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 21 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs $0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Ali will earn 51 x $0.5 = $25.5 from the first trout.
He will earn 45 x $0.5 = $22.5 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 6-2 = 4. He will earn 21 x $0.5 = $10.5 per each of them. So he will earn 4 * 10.5 = =42.0
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $25.5 + $22.5 + $42.0= $90.
#### 90","To solve the problem and calculate how much Ali will earn from selling the trouts, we need to determine the total weight of all the trouts and then calculate the total cost based on the price per kilogram. Here is the step-by-step chain of thought:

1. **Identify the known weights:**
   - First trout: 51 kilograms
   - Second trout: 45 kilograms
   - Last trout: 21 kilograms

2. **Let the weights of the other three trouts be denoted as \(w_4\), \(w_5\), and \(w_6\).**

3. **Set up the equation for the total weight:**  
   We know Ali caught a total of 6 trouts. Thus, the total weight \(W\) of all the trouts can be expressed as:
   \[
   W = 51 + 45 + 21 + w_4 + w_5 + w_6
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the known trouts:**  
   \[
   W_{\text{known}} = 51 + 45 + 21 = 117 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

5. **Determine the total weight in terms of the unknowns:**  
   \[
   W = 117 + w_4 + w_5 + w_6
   \]

6. **Given that we have no information about the weights of the other three trouts, we cannot calculate the exact total weight \(W\). Therefore, we need to assume the weights of the other trouts to find the total weight and earnings.**

7. **Assumption for further calculation:**  
   Without specific weights for the other trouts, a possible assumption might be that their total combined weight is zero (as a simplest case) or we are focusing on the trouts with known weights. However, for a complete calculation, we often assume the additional weights are positive or zero. Let's proceed with considering only known weights, assuming the problem focuses on these specific known weights.

8. **Calculate the earnings based on known weights:**  
   - Cost per kilogram = $0.5
   - Total weight of known trouts = 117 kilograms
   - Total earnings from known trouts:
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 117 \times 0.5 = 58.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

9. **Conclusion:**  
   Without additional information on the weights of the other three trouts, the earnings based on the known weights of the trouts is $58.5.

3,"Gabriel works a 11-hour shift each day, 3 days a week. He earns ₺27 per hour and gets a ₺128 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Gabriel make in November if the company performed very well for the whole month?","In a day, Gabriel makes 11 * 27 = ₺297
If he works 3 days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 3 * 4= 12 days.
Since he makes ₺297 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 12 * 297= ₺3564.
He also got a 128 * 4 = ₺512 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of November.
At the end of November, he earned 3564 + 512 = ₺4076.
#### 4076","To determine how much money Gabriel made in November, we need to break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total hours worked per week:**
   - Gabriel works 11 hours each day for 3 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked per week = 11 hours/day × 3 days/week = 33 hours/week.

2. **Calculate Gabriel's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Gabriel earns ₺27 per hour.
   - Therefore, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage = 33 hours/week × ₺27/hour = ₺891/week.

3. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Gabriel receives a ₺128 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Since the company performed very well the entire month, he receives this bonus each week.
   - Therefore, his total weekly earnings = ₺891 (from hours worked) + ₺128 (bonus) = ₺1,019/week.

4. **Determine the number of weeks Gabriel worked in November:**
   - November has 30 days. If he works 3 days a week, we can determine how many weeks he worked by dividing the total days he worked by the number of working days per week.
   - Total working days in November = (3 days/week) × (4 full weeks) + remainder days.
   - To find out the remainder days: November has 30 days, and 4 weeks make 28 days (since 4 × 7 = 28).
   - Therefore, remainder days = 30 days - 28 days = 2 days.
   - So, in the first 4 weeks, he works 4 × 3 = 12 days, plus 2 additional days in the 5th week.

5. **Calculate the earnings for the first 4 full weeks:**
   - For the first 4 weeks, his earnings = 4 weeks × ₺1,019/week = ₺4,076.

6. **Calculate the earnings for the additional 2 days:**
   - For the 5th week, he works 2 days.
   - Therefore, hours worked in the 5th week = 2 days × 11 hours/day = 22 hours.
   - Earnings from hours worked in the 5th week = 22 hours × ₺27/hour = ₺594.
   - Since he worked fewer than 3 days, he does not earn the weekly bonus for the 5th week.

7. **Calculate the total earnings for November:**
   - Total earnings for November = earnings for the first 4 weeks + earnings for the additional 2 days.
   - Total earnings for November = ₺4,076 + ₺594 = ₺4,670.

Answer: Gabriel made ₺4,670 in November.",4670
4,"Ravi works a 12-hour shift each day, 5 days a week. He earns €13 per hour and gets a €351 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Ravi make in March if the company performed very well for the whole month?","In a day, Ravi makes 12 * 13 = €156
If he works 5 days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= 20 days.
Since he makes €156 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 156= €3120.
He also got a 351 * 4 = €1404 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of March.
At the end of March, he earned 3120 + 1404 = €4524.
#### 4524","To determine how much money Ravi made in March, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

1. **Calculate Ravi's Daily Earnings:**
   - Ravi works 12 hours per day.
   - His hourly rate is €13.
   - Daily earnings = 12 hours/day × €13/hour = €156/day.

2. **Calculate Ravi's Weekly Earnings from Hourly Work:**
   - Ravi works 5 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings from hourly work = €156/day × 5 days/week = €780/week.

3. **Add Weekly Bonus:**
   - Ravi receives a €351 bonus each week.
   - Total weekly earnings = €780/week + €351/week = €1131/week.

4. **Determine the Number of Weeks in March:**
   - March has 31 days.
   - Number of weeks in March = 31 days ÷ 7 days/week ≈ 4 weeks and 3 extra days.

5. **Calculate Earnings for the Full Weeks:**
   - Ravi earns €1131 per full week.
   - For 4 full weeks, earnings = 4 weeks × €1131/week = €4524.

6. **Calculate Earnings for the Extra Days:**
   - Ravi works 5 days a week, so the 3 extra days are part of a partial workweek.
   - Daily earnings = €156/day.
   - Earnings for 3 extra days = 3 days × €156/day = €468.

7. **Total Earnings for March:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings for 4 full weeks + Earnings for 3 extra days.
   - Total earnings = €4524 + €468 = €4992.

8,"Emma went to their greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found four-sixths as many bees as ladybugs in the plot. If there were 165 ladybugs, calculate the total number of insects in the plot.","If there were 165 ladybugs, the total number of bees in the plot is 2/3 * 165 ladybugs = 110 bees
The total number of insects in the plot is 110 bees + 165 ladybugs = 275 insects
#### 275","To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in the plot, which includes both the ladybugs and the bees. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of ladybugs**:  
   The problem states there are 165 ladybugs.  
   \[
   \text{Number of ladybugs} = 165
   \]

2. **Determine the fraction of bees to ladybugs**:  
   Emma found four-sixths as many bees as ladybugs. Four-sixths can be simplified to two-thirds.  
   \[
   \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of bees**:  
   To find the number of bees, multiply the number of ladybugs by the fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\).  
   \[
   \text{Number of bees} = 165 \times \frac{2}{3}

9,"In a 100-item quiz, 30% of the questions are physics, and the rest are equally divided as economics and literature questions. If Olivia is sure to get 30% of the physics questions, and 1/2 of the economics and literature questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?","The economics and literature questions comprises 100% - 30% = 70% of the quiz.
There are 100 questions x 30/100 = 30 physics questions.
There are a total of 100 questions x 70/100 = 70 economics and literature questions.
If Olivia is sure to get 30% of the physics questions, then this means she is sure of her 30 questions x 30/100 = 9 points.
From the economics and literature questions, she is sure to get 1/2 of it correctly so that is 70 questions * 1/2 = 35 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 9 points + 35 points = 44 points in her quiz.
#### 44","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions belong to each subject and how many Olivia is sure to answer correctly. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of questions for each subject:**
   - According to the problem, the quiz contains 100 questions in total.
   - 30% of the questions are physics questions. So, the number of physics questions is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of physics questions} = 0.30 \times 100 = 30
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions for economics and literature:**
   - The total number of questions that are not physics is \(100 - 30 = 70\).
   - These 70 questions are equally divided between economics and literature.
   - Therefore, the number of questions for each (economics and literature) is:
     \[
     \text{Number of economics questions} = \text{Number of literature questions} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
     \]

3. **Determine how many questions Olivia is sure to get correct:**
   - **Physics questions:**
     - Olivia is sure to get 30% of the physics questions correct.
     - Thus, the number of physics questions she knows is:
       \[
       \text{Physics questions correct} = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
       \]

   - **Economics questions:**
     - Olivia is sure to get half of the economics questions correct.
     - Therefore, the number of economics questions she knows is:
       \[
       \text{Economics questions correct} = \frac{1}{2} \times 35 = 17.5
       \]
     - Since the number of questions answered must be whole, we assume Olivia is certain to get 17 questions correct (typically rounding down in such scenarios).

   - **Literature questions:**
     - Similarly, Olivia is sure to get half of the literature questions correct.
     - Thus, the number of literature questions she knows is:
       \[
       \text{Literature questions correct} = \frac{1}{2} \times 35 = 17.5
       \]
     - Again, assuming Olivia is certain to get 17 questions correct.

4. **Calculate the total number of questions Olivia is sure to get correct:**
   - Add the correct answers for each subject to find the total number of questions she is sure to get right:
     \[
     \text{Total correct questions} = 9 + 17 + 17 = 43
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Olivia is sure to get 43 points.

12,"Emma has a flower bed that is 204 feet long. Emma wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Emma's flowers grow 7 feet wide so she needs to leave 12.75 feet between every plant. Emma already owns 13 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €13 at the store, how much money will Emma spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Emma's flower bed is 204 feet / 12.75 feet per plant = 16 plants needed.
Emma needs to buy 16 plants - 13 plants = 3 plants needed to purchase.
Emma will spend 3 plants * €13 = €39.
#### 39","To determine how much money Emma will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed with plants, we need to go through several steps. Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the total number of plants needed:**

   - The flower bed is 204 feet long.
   - Each flower occupies a width of 7 feet.
   - There needs to be 12.75 feet of space between each plant.

   To find out how many plants can be placed, consider the space each plant requires including the gap:

   \[
   \text{Space per plant} = \text{Width of plant} + \text{Space between plants} = 7 + 12.75 = 19.75 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed:**

   - Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires:

   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = \frac{204}{19.75} \approx 10.33
   \]

   Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, round down to the nearest whole number:

   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = 10
   \]

3. **Account for the plants Emma already owns:**

   - Emma already has 13 plants.
   - Since she only needs 10 plants to fill the bed, she already has enough.

4. **Determine if Emma needs to buy any more plants:**

   - Emma needs 10 plants and already has 13, so she does not need to buy any more plants.

5. **Calculate the cost:**

   - Since Emma does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost is:

   \[
   \text{Cost} = 0 \times 13 = 0 \text{ Euros}
   \]

Answer: Emma will spend €0 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",0
13,"Theo works a 9-hour shift each day, 6 days a week. He earns ₺14 per hour and gets a ₺575 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Theo make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?","In a day, Theo makes 9 * 14 = ₺126
If he works 6 days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 6 * 4= 24 days.
Since he makes ₺126 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 24 * 126= ₺3024.
He also got a 575 * 4 = ₺2300 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.
At the end of April, he earned 3024 + 2300 = ₺5324.
#### 5324","To determine how much money Theo made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Theo's daily earnings:**
   - Theo works 9 hours per day and earns ₺14 per hour.
   - Daily earnings = 9 hours/day × ₺14/hour = ₺126/day.

2. **Calculate Theo's weekly earnings without the bonus:**
   - Theo works 6 days each week.
   - Weekly earnings (without bonus) = ₺126/day × 6 days/week = ₺756/week.

3. **Include the weekly bonus:**
   - Theo receives a ₺575 bonus each week when the company performs well.
   - Total weekly earnings with bonus = ₺756/week + ₺575/week = ₺1,331/week.

4. **Determine the number of weeks in April:**
   - April has 30 days. 
   - Theo works 6 days a week, so we need to calculate how many full weeks are in April.
   - Number of weeks in April = 30 days ÷ 6 days/week = 5 weeks (since 30 ÷ 6 equals exactly 5).

5. **Calculate Theo's total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings for April = Total weekly earnings × Number of weeks in April.
   - Total earnings for April = ₺1,331/week × 5 weeks = ₺6,655.

14,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of oats, hay, beets and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys fourteen 5-kg bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty three 44-kg packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys twenty 19-kg sacks. If his farm truck can carry 120 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6 * 3 = 18 kgs of wheats.
He is buying 14 * 5 = 70 kgs of beets.
He is buying 20 * 19 = 380 kgs of hay.
He is buying 33 * 44 = 1452 kgs of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 18 + 70 + 380 + 1452 = 1920 kgs.
Thus, the farmer needs 1920 / 120 = 16 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 16","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of each type of feed and the number of trips required by the farmer's truck to transport all the feed. Here's how we can compute it step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the wheats:**
   - Number of boxes of wheats: 6
   - Weight per box: 3 kg
   - Total weight of wheats = 6 boxes × 3 kg/box = 18 kg

2. **Calculate the total weight of the beets:**
   - Number of bags of beets: 14
   - Weight per bag: 5 kg
   - Total weight of beets = 14 bags × 5 kg/bag = 70 kg

3. **Calculate the total weight of the oats:**
   - Number of packs of oats: 30
   - Weight per pack: 44 kg
   - Total weight of oats = 30 packs × 44 kg/pack = 1320 kg

4. **Calculate the total weight of the hay:**
   - Number of sacks of hay: 20
   - Weight per sack: 19 kg
   - Total weight of hay = 20 sacks × 19 kg/sack = 380 kg

5. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**
   - Total weight = Weight of wheats + Weight of beets + Weight of oats + Weight of hay
   - Total weight = 18 kg + 70 kg + 1320 kg + 380 kg = 1788 kg

6. **Determine the number of trips needed:**
   - Truck capacity per trip: 120 kg
   - Number of trips required = Total weight / Truck capacity
   - Number of trips required = 1788 kg / 120 kg/trip = 14.9 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a partial trip, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 15 trips.

15,Santiago is rolling a d6 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.
#### 25","To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a d6:**

   A standard six-sided die (d6) has the numbers 1 through 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

   - Total possible outcomes when rolling a d6: 6 (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
   - Favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 3): 3 (numbers 4, 5, 6)

   Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

2. **Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row on a d6:**

   The odd numbers on a d6 are 1, 3, and 5.

   - Probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll:
     \[
     P(\text{odd on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

   - Probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll (independent of the first roll):
     \[
     P(\text{odd on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

   Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row:
   \[
   P(\text{two odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd on first roll}) \times P(\text{odd on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

3. **Compare the probabilities:**

   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \(\frac{1}{2}\)
   - Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row: \(\frac{1}{4}\)

   To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two odd numbers in a row, we calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage of the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row.

   Difference in probabilities:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

   Express this difference as a percentage of \(\frac{1}{4}\):
   \[
   \left(\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}}\right) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
   \]

Answer: It is 100% more likely that Santiago rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.",100
16,"To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay $0.4 for each minute of your call. After 45 minutes, that price drops to $0.2 per minute. How much would a 65-minute call cost?","First 45 minutes would be a cost of 45 * 0.4 = $18.
After that, there are 65 - 45 = 20 minutes of the call left.
And these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $4.
So in total, the 65-minute call would cost 18 + 4 = $22.
#### 22","To determine the total cost of a 65-minute call based on the given pricing structure, we need to calculate the cost for the first 45 minutes and then the cost for the remaining minutes at a reduced rate.

1. **Identify the cost for the first 45 minutes:**
   - The rate for the first 45 minutes is $0.4 per minute.
   - Therefore, for 45 minutes:  
     \[
     45 \times 0.4 = 18
     \]
   - Cost for the first 45 minutes is $18.

2. **Determine the remaining time after the initial 45 minutes:**
   - The total call duration is 65 minutes.
   - Subtract the initial 45 minutes to find the remaining time:  
     \[
     65 - 45 = 20
     \]
   - The remaining call duration is 20 minutes.

3. **Identify the cost for the additional 20 minutes:**
   - The rate for the time after 45 minutes drops to $0.2 per minute.
   - Therefore, for 20 minutes:  
     \[
     20 \times 0.2 = 4
     \]
   - Cost for the additional 20 minutes is $4.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the 65-minute call:**
   - Add the cost of the first 45 minutes to the cost of the additional 20 minutes:  
     \[
     18 + 4 = 22
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total cost of a 65-minute call is $22.

17,Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years. Xavier's uncle saw the Comet when he was 31 years old. Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. How old was Xavier when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Xavier saw the Comet for the second time when he was 31 years * 3= 93 years old.
Comet Hyakutake can be seen every 80 years, so Xavier saw the comet for the first time when he was 93 years - 80 years = 13 years old.
#### 13","To solve this problem, we'll go through each step logically, based on the given information.

1. **Identify the age at which uncle saw the comet**:  
   Xavier's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.

2. **Calculate the age of the uncle when Xavier saw the comet the second time**:  
   It's stated that Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet.  
   Uncle's age when he saw the comet = 31.  
   Therefore, the age of Xavier when he saw the comet the second time = 3 × 31 = 93.

3. **Determine the interval between comet sightings**:  
   Since Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years, the time between the uncle's sighting and Xavier's second sighting is 80 years.

4. **Calculate the uncle's age at the second sighting**:  
   Uncle's age when the second sighting occurred = 31 (his age at the first sighting) + 80 (years between sightings) = 111 years old.

5. **Calculate Xavier's age difference between the two sightings**:  
   Xavier was 93 when he saw the comet the second time.  
   To find how many years after the uncle's first sighting this second sighting occurred, subtract 80 years from Xavier's age at the second sighting:  
   Xavier's age during the second sighting - uncle's age increase = 93 - (111 - 31) = 93 - 80 = 13.

6. **Determine Xavier's age at the first sighting**:  
   Since there are 80 years between sightings and Xavier was 13 years younger at the first sighting, subtract 80 years minus 13 from his age at the second sighting:  
   Xavier's age at the first sighting = 93 (age at the second sighting) - 80 + 13 = 26.

Therefore, Xavier was 26 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

20,"If Oscar and Mia have 600 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Mia getting 120 yards more than Oscar, how much is left over for Oscar?","Let x be the amount of fence Oscar gets and y be the amount Mia gets. We know that y = x + 120, and y + x = 600.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+120=600
Subtracting the 120 from both sides, we get 2x=480
We divide each side by two, leaving x=240. This means Oscar has 240 yards of fence left over.
#### 240","To solve the problem of how much fence Oscar gets, we need to set up and solve a simple algebraic equation. Here's how we can break this down:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of fence in yards that Oscar receives.

2. **Express Mia's Share:**
   - Mia receives 120 yards more than Oscar, so Mia's share can be expressed as \( x + 120 \) yards.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total length of the fence is 600 yards. Therefore, the sum of what Oscar and Mia receive should equal 600 yards:
     \[
     x + (x + 120) = 600
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     2x + 120 = 600
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Start by isolating the term with \( x \) by subtracting 120 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x = 600 - 120
     \]
     \[
     2x = 480
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{480}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 240
     \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   - Oscar receives 240 yards of fence.

Therefore, Oscar is left with 240 yards of the fence.

Arjun spent ¥1.0 on crackers because 4 x 0.25 = 1.0
Arjun spent 1088.0 on pretzels because 1089.0 - 1.0 = 1088.0
Arjun bought 1088 pretzels because 1088.0 / 1.0 = 1088
#### 1088","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Arjun bought. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert Arjun's total spending from yen to cents:**
   - Arjun spent ¥1100.
   - We need to convert this amount to cents. Since 1 yen is equivalent to 1 cent in this context, Arjun spent 1100 cents.

2. **Determine the amount of money Arjun had left:**
   - Arjun had 1% of his money left in change.
   - 1% of 1100 cents is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \frac{1}{100} \times 1100 = 11 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount Arjun spent on snacks:**
   - Since Arjun had 11 cents left, the amount he spent on snacks is:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on snacks} = 1100 - 11 = 1089 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the crackers:**
   - Arjun bought 4 bags of crackers, each costing 25 cents.
   - The total cost for the crackers is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of crackers} = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Determine the amount spent on pretzels:**
   - Subtract the cost of the crackers from the total amount spent on snacks to find the amount spent on pretzels:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 1089 - 100 = 989 \text{ cents}
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of pretzels Arjun bought:**
   - Each pretzel costs 100 cents.
   - The number of pretzels Arjun bought is:
     \[
     \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{989}{100} = 9.89
     \]
   - Since Arjun cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, he must have bought 9 pretzels.

7. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Cost for 9 pretzels is \(9 \times 100 = 900\) cents.
   - Total cost for 4 crackers and 9 pretzels is \(100 + 900 = 1000\) cents.
   - Total spent is 1000 cents, leaving him with 89 cents, but since he had 11 cents left, it confirms he bought 9 pretzels.

Thus, Arjun bought 9 pretzels.

26,"Luis went to their orchard to pick some strawberries and found two-fourths as many ladybugs as bees in the garden. If there were 180 bees, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.","If there were 180 bees, the total number of ladybugs in the garden is 1/2 * 180 bees = 90 ladybugs
The total number of insects in the garden is 90 ladybugs + 180 bees = 270 insects
#### 270","To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we need to calculate the number of ladybugs and then sum this with the number of bees. Let's go through the steps one by one:

1. **Identify the number of bees**: Luis found 180 bees in the garden.

2. **Determine the fraction of ladybugs compared to bees**: The problem states that there are two-fourths as many ladybugs as bees. Two-fourths simplifies to one-half. This means the number of ladybugs is half the number of bees.

3. **Calculate the number of ladybugs**: Since there are 180 bees and the number of ladybugs is half, we calculate the number of ladybugs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of ladybugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 180 = 90
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of insects**: The total number of insects is the sum of the number of bees and the number of ladybugs.
   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 180 \, (\text{bees}) + 90 \, (\text{ladybugs}) = 270
   \]

Thus, the total number of insects in the garden is 270.

27,"Olga has a flower bed that is 200 feet long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 5 feet wide so she needs to leave 12.5 feet between every plant. Olga already owns 13 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₺13 at the store, how much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Olga's flower bed is 200 feet / 12.5 feet per plant = 16 plants needed.
Olga needs to buy 16 plants - 13 plants = 3 plants needed to purchase.
Olga will spend 3 plants * ₺13 = ₺39.
#### 39","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional plants Olga needs to purchase to fill her flower bed and then calculate the total cost.

1. **Determine the spacing between plants:**
   - Each plant occupies a space of 5 feet (width of the plant) plus 12.5 feet (spacing between plants).
   - Total space per plant = 5 feet + 12.5 feet = 17.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed for the flower bed:**
   - The total length of the flower bed is 200 feet.
   - Number of plants needed = Total length / Space per plant = 200 feet / 17.5 feet per plant.
   - Number of plants needed = 11.4286. Since Olga cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she needs 12 plants.

3. **Determine how many additional plants Olga needs to buy:**
   - Olga already owns 13 flowers.
   - Number of additional plants needed = Total plants needed - Plants Olga already owns = 12 - 13 = -1.
   - Since the result is negative, Olga already has more than enough plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of additional plants:**
   - Since Olga does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost is 0.

28,There are 8 periods in the day for a normal student but Gabriel has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 50 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends five-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 8+1=9 classes a day
That means he spends 50*9=450 minutes per day in class
So he spends 450*5=2250 minutes a week
That means he spends 2250*5/6=1875 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 2250+1875+1875=6000 minutes per week
So he spends 6000/60=100 hours per week
#### 100","To determine how many hours Gabriel spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem step by step. Here we go:

1. **Calculate the daily class time for Gabriel:**
   - A normal student has 8 periods per day.
   - Gabriel takes 1 extra class, so he has \(8 + 1 = 9\) classes each day.
   - Each class is 50 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the daily class time is \(9 \times 50 = 450\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the weekly class time:**
   - Gabriel attends school 5 days a week.
   - The weekly class time is \(450 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2250 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Determine the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - Gabriel spends five-sixths of his weekly class minutes on the weekend (including both Saturday and Sunday) as extra learning time.
   - The extra learning time for the weekend is \(\frac{5}{6} \times 2250 = 1875\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**
   - Total weekly learning time includes both the class time and the extra weekend learning time.
   - Total time in minutes is \(2250 \text{ class minutes} + 1875 \text{ weekend minutes} = 4125\) minutes.

5. **Convert total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The total hours spent learning each week is \(\frac{4125}{60} = 68.75\) hours.

Using these steps, we find that Gabriel spends a total of 68.75 hours a week learning.

Answer: 68.75 hours a week.",68
29,"A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of oats, hay, cucumbers and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys five 5-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 7-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty five 43-pound packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys sixteen 16-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 110 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of wheats.
He is buying 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of cucumbers.
He is buying 16 * 16 = 256 pounds of hay.
He is buying 35 * 43 = 1505 pounds of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 25 + 84 + 256 + 1505 = 1870 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 1870 / 110 = 17 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 17","To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and then divide it by the carrying capacity of the truck.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the wheats:**
   - The farmer buys 5 boxes of wheats, each weighing 5 pounds.
   - Total weight of wheats = 5 boxes × 5 pounds/box = 25 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the cucumbers:**
   - The farmer buys 12 bags of cucumbers, each weighing 7 pounds.
   - Total weight of cucumbers = 12 bags × 7 pounds/bag = 84 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the oats:**
   - The farmer buys 35 packs of oats, each weighing 43 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 35 packs × 43 pounds/pack = 1,505 pounds.

4. **Calculate the total weight of the hay:**
   - The farmer buys 16 sacks of hay, each weighing 16 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 16 sacks × 16 pounds/sack = 256 pounds.

5. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**
   - Total weight = weight of wheats + weight of cucumbers + weight of oats + weight of hay
   - Total weight = 25 pounds + 84 pounds + 1,505 pounds + 256 pounds = 1,870 pounds.

6. **Determine how many trips are needed:**
   - The truck can carry 110 pounds per trip.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   - Number of trips = 1,870 pounds / 110 pounds/trip ≈ 17.00 trips.

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he needs 18 trips to transport all the feed.

Answer: 18 trips",18
30,"At the beginning of the party, there were 60 artists and 28 doctors. After 45 minutes, one-eighth of the total number of people left. How many doctors are left if 23 artists stayed at the party?","There were a total of 60 artists + 28 doctors = 88 people who attended the party.
After 45 minutes, 88 people * 1/8 = 11 people left the party.
This means 88 people - 11 people = 77 people stayed.
Out of the 77 who stayed, 77 people - 23 artists = 54 were doctors.
#### 54","To solve this problem, let's go through each step methodically:

1. **Determine the Initial Number of People at the Party:**
   - Artists: 60
   - Doctors: 28
   - Total initial number of people = 60 (artists) + 28 (doctors) = 88 people.

2. **Calculate the Number of People Who Left:**
   - One-eighth of the total number of people left after 45 minutes.
   - Number of people who left = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \) people.

3. **Determine the Number of People Remaining:**
   - Total number of people remaining = 88 (initial total) - 11 (left) = 77 people.

4. **Calculate the Number of Artists Who Left:**
   - Given that 23 artists stayed at the party.
   - Initial number of artists = 60
   - Number of artists who left = 60 (initial) - 23 (stayed) = 37 artists.

5. **Calculate the Number of Doctors Who Left:**
   - Number of people who left = 11 (from step 2).
   - Since 37 artists left, we can find the number of doctors who left by subtracting the number of artists who left from the total number of people who left:
   - Number of doctors who left = 11 (total left) - 37 (artists left) = -26.
   - The negative result indicates that not all people who left were artists. Let's correct this:
   - Since 37 artists left, and only 11 people left in total, it means the calculation should be:
   - Artists who left = 11 (total left) - X (doctors left) = 37.
   - Therefore, X (doctors left) = 11 - 37 = -26, which is incorrect due to the wrong assumption.
   - Correct calculation: If 37 artists left, it implies an error in understanding, as only 11 could leave. Re-evaluate:
   - Artists who could have left = 11 (total left), so doctors who left = 0.
   - Correct understanding: 11 people left, all could be artists.

6. **Calculate the Number of Doctors Remaining:**
   - Initial number of doctors = 28
   - Since no doctors left (as all 11 who left were artists), the number of doctors remaining = 28.

Answer: 28 doctors are left at the party.",28

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+50=740
Subtracting the 50 from both sides, we get 2x=690
We divide each side by two, leaving x=345. This means Nadia has 345 yards of fence left over.
#### 345","To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step using a chain of thought approach:

1. **Define Variables**:  
   Let's say Nadia gets \( x \) yards of fence. According to the problem, Kimia gets 50 yards more than Nadia. Therefore, Kimia gets \( x + 50 \) yards.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:  
   Together, they have a total of 740 yards of fence. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + (x + 50) = 740
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation**:  
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 50 = 740
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:  
   Subtract 50 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 690
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

Quinn already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣6 at the store, how much money will Quinn spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Quinn's flower bed is 169 meters / 13.0 meters per plant = 13 plants needed.
Quinn needs to buy 13 plants - 11 plants = 2 plants needed to purchase.
Quinn will spend 2 plants * ₣6 = ₣12.
#### 12","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional flowering plants Quinn needs to purchase and then calculate the total cost.

1. **Understand the spacing and width of each plant:**
   - Each flower plant grows 2 meters wide.
   - Quinn needs to leave 13.0 meters between each plant.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies:**
   - The space occupied by one plant includes its width and the space between it and the next plant.
   - Total space per plant = Width of the plant + Space between plants = 2 meters + 13.0 meters = 15.0 meters.

3. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The length of the flower bed is 169 meters.
   - To find out how many plants can fit, divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each plant occupies:
     \[
     \text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Total space per plant}} = \frac{169 \text{ meters}}{15.0 \text{ meters/plant}} \approx 11.27
     \]
   - Since Quinn cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 11 whole plants in the flower bed.

4. **Account for the plants Quinn already owns:**
   - Quinn already owns 11 flowers.
   - Since the flower bed can accommodate 11 plants, and Quinn already has 11, she does not need to purchase any additional plants.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Since Quinn does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost is ₣0.

Qasim spent $1034 because 1100 - 66 = 1034
Qasim spent $1.5 on popcorn because 5 x 0.3 = 1.5
Qasim spent 1032.5 on crackers because 1034.0 - 1.5 = 1032.5
Qasim bought 826 crackers because 1032.5 / 1.25 = 826
#### 826","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using a chain of thought:

1. **Understand the total money spent and remaining:**
   - Qasim spent $1100 and had 6% of his money left in change.
   - This means he spent 94% of his money (100% - 6% = 94%).

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Qasim had initially:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total amount of money Qasim had.
   - He spent 94% of \( x \), which equals $1100.
   - Therefore, \( 0.94x = 1100 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1100}{0.94} = 1170.21
   \]
   - So, Qasim initially had $1170.21.

4. **Calculate the amount of money left as change:**
   - 6% of \( x \) is left as change.
   - Change = \( 0.06 \times 1170.21 = 70.21 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the items bought:**
   - Total cost of items = Initial money - Change
   - Total cost = \( 1170.21 - 70.21 = 1100 \).

6. **Calculate the cost of popcorn:**
   - Popcorn costs 30 cents per bag.
   - Qasim bought 5 bags of popcorn.
   - Total cost of popcorn = \( 5 \times 30 = 150 \) cents.

7. **Convert the cost of popcorn to dollars:**
   - 150 cents = $1.50.

8. **Calculate the remaining money spent on crackers:**
   - Total money spent on crackers = Total cost - Cost of popcorn
   - Money spent on crackers = \( 1100 - 1.50 = 1098.50 \).

9. **Calculate the number of crackers bought:**
   - Crackers cost 125 cents each.
   - Convert $1098.50 to cents: \( 1098.50 \times 100 = 109850 \) cents.
   - Number of crackers = \( \frac{109850}{125} = 878.8 \).

35,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 150 calories per serving. If a 200 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 800 calories?","If the total calorie target is 2300 and I have consumed 800 calories then I have 2300-800 = 1500 calories left to eat
If each serving of cookies has 150 calories and I only have 1500 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1500/150 of a serving = 10 of a serving
We also know that a 200 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 200 oz/5 = 40 oz
If I can only eat 10 of a serving, then I can eat only 40 * 10 = 40*10 = 400 oz
#### 400","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of cookies you can consume to stay within your daily calorie target. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine Remaining Calorie Allowance**: 
   - You have a daily calorie target of 2300 calories.
   - You have already consumed 800 calories.
   - Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:
     \[
     2300 \text{ calories (target)} - 800 \text{ calories (already consumed)} = 1500 \text{ calories remaining}
     \]

2. **Determine Calories per Ounce of Cookies**:
   - Each serving of cookies is 150 calories.
   - The bag contains 5 servings and weighs 200 ounces.
   - Calculate the ounces per serving:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 40 \text{ ounces per serving}
     \]
   - Therefore, each ounce of cookies contains:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ calories}}{40 \text{ ounces}} = 3.75 \text{ calories per ounce}
     \]

3. **Determine How Many Ounces You Can Eat**:
   - With 1500 calories remaining, calculate how many ounces of cookies you can consume:
     \[
     \frac{1500 \text{ calories}}{3.75 \text{ calories per ounce}} = 400 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Check Against the Bag Size**:
   - The bag contains only 200 ounces.
   - Since 400 ounces exceeds the bag size, you can only consume up to 200 ounces, which is the total available in the bag.

Therefore, you can eat up to 200 ounces of cookies without exceeding your calorie target.

36,Oliver collects garbage from 5 different apartment complexes. The first 4 have 300 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 4 combined. Oliver collects garbage 4 times a week from each place and he gets paid $0.3 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,"The first 4 complexes have 4*300=1200 apartments
The 5th one has 1200*0.35=420 more apartments than those 4 combined. So it has 1200+420=1620 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 1620+1200=2820 apartments each time
That means he visits 2820*4=11280 apartments every week
So he makes 11280*$0.3=$3384 every week
#### 3384","To solve this problem, we will break it down into clear steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first four complexes:**
   - Each of the first four complexes has 300 apartments.
   - Total apartments in these four complexes = 4 complexes × 300 apartments each = 1200 apartments.

2. **Determine the number of apartments in the fifth complex:**
   - The fifth complex is 35% bigger than the combined total of the first four complexes.
   - 35% of 1200 apartments = 0.35 × 1200 = 420 apartments.
   - Total apartments in the fifth complex = 1200 (existing apartments) + 420 (additional apartments) = 1620 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments Oliver services:**
   - Total apartments serviced = 1200 (first four complexes) + 1620 (fifth complex) = 2820 apartments.

4. **Determine the number of collections Oliver makes in a week:**
   - Oliver collects 4 times a week per apartment complex.
   - The total number of collections per week = 4 collections/week × 5 complexes = 20 collections per week.

5. **Calculate Oliver's total earnings per collection cycle:**
   - Oliver gets paid $0.3 per collection for each apartment.
   - Earnings per collection cycle = 2820 apartments × $0.3 = $846 per cycle.

6. **Calculate Oliver's total earnings in a week:**
   - Since Oliver makes 4 collections per complex and there are 5 complexes, his weekly total collection cycles amount to 20.
   - Total weekly earnings = 20 collections × $846 per collection cycle = $16,920.

Thus, the final answer is:

37,"A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of hay, wheats, beets and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys six 7-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys thirteen 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty four 41-kg packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys eighteen 17-kg sacks. If his farm truck can carry 140 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6 * 7 = 42 kgs of oats.
He is buying 13 * 6 = 78 kgs of beets.
He is buying 18 * 17 = 306 kgs of wheats.
He is buying 34 * 41 = 1394 kgs of hay.
The weight of all the feed is 42 + 78 + 306 + 1394 = 1820 kgs.
Thus, the farmer needs 1820 / 140 = 13 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 13","To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the overall total weight. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the oats:**
   - The farmer buys six 7-kg boxes of oats.
   - Total weight of oats = 6 boxes × 7 kg/box = 42 kg.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the beets:**
   - The farmer buys thirteen 6-kg bags of beets.
   - Total weight of beets = 13 bags × 6 kg/bag = 78 kg.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the hay:**
   - The farmer buys thirty-four 41-kg packs of hay.
   - Total weight of hay = 34 packs × 41 kg/pack = 1,394 kg.

4. **Calculate the total weight of the wheats:**
   - The farmer buys eighteen 17-kg sacks of wheats.
   - Total weight of wheats = 18 sacks × 17 kg/sack = 306 kg.

5. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**
   - Total weight = weight of oats + weight of beets + weight of hay + weight of wheats
   - Total weight = 42 kg + 78 kg + 1,394 kg + 306 kg = 1,820 kg.

6. **Determine the number of trips needed:**
   - The truck can carry 140 kg per trip.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   - Number of trips = 1,820 kg ÷ 140 kg/trip = 13 trips with a remainder.

7. **Account for any remainder:**
   - 1,820 kg ÷ 140 kg/trip = 13 trips with a remainder of 20 kg.
   - Since there is a remainder, an additional trip is needed for the remaining 20 kg.

8. **Calculate the total number of trips:**
   - Total trips = 13 full trips + 1 additional trip = 14 trips.

38,There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Benjamin has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 55 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends two-fifths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 7+1=8 classes a day
That means he spends 55*8=440 minutes per day in class
So he spends 440*5=2200 minutes a week
That means he spends 2200*2/5=880 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 2200+880+880=3960 minutes per week
So he spends 3960/60=66 hours per week
#### 66","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Benjamin spends learning in a week, including his school classes and extra learning time on weekends.

1. **Calculate the number of classes Benjamin has per day:**
   - A normal student has 7 periods.
   - Benjamin has 1 extra class.
   - Total classes per day for Benjamin = 7 + 1 = 8 classes.

2. **Calculate the total minutes Benjamin spends in classes per day:**
   - Each class is 55 minutes long.
   - Total minutes per day = 8 classes × 55 minutes/class = 440 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total minutes Benjamin spends in classes per week:**
   - He goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Total minutes per week = 440 minutes/day × 5 days = 2200 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total weekend learning time:**
   - He spends two-fifths of his weekly class minutes on each day of the weekend.
   - Total weekend minutes = 2/5 of 2200 minutes = (2/5) × 2200 = 880 minutes.
   - Since he spends this time equally on Saturday and Sunday, each day he spends 880/2 = 440 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total minutes Benjamin spends learning in a week:**
   - Total weekly learning minutes = class minutes + weekend learning minutes
   - Total weekly learning minutes = 2200 minutes (classes) + 880 minutes (weekend) = 3080 minutes.

6. **Convert the total minutes into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total hours = 3080 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 51.3333 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Benjamin spends learning per week is 51.33 hours (rounded to two decimal places).

40,"Wei caught 5 trouts last Sunday, the first trout he caught weighs 48 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 58 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 30 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs $0.25, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Wei will earn 48 x $0.25 = $12.0 from the first trout.
He will earn 58 x $0.25 = $14.5 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 5-2 = 3. He will earn 30 x $0.25 = $7.5 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 7.5 = =22.5
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $12.0 + $14.5 + $22.5= $49.
#### 49","To determine how much Wei will earn after selling all the trouts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Unknown Weights:**
   - Wei caught a total of 5 trouts.
   - The weights of the first, second, and fifth trouts are 48 kg, 58 kg, and 30 kg respectively.
   - Let the weights of the third and fourth trouts be \( x \) kg and \( y \) kg.

2. **Calculate Total Weight of All Trouts:**
   - The total weight of all trouts is given by the equation:
     \[
     48 + 58 + x + y + 30
     \]
   - Simplifying the known weights:
     \[
     48 + 58 + 30 = 136
     \]
   - Therefore, the total weight equation becomes:
     \[
     136 + x + y
     \]

3. **Determine Total Revenue:**
   - The cost of trout per kilogram is $0.25.
   - The total revenue from selling all the trouts is:
     \[
     0.25 \times (136 + x + y)
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the problem does not provide the weights of the third and fourth trouts, we cannot determine the exact total weight of all trouts.
   - Therefore, the exact earnings cannot be calculated without additional information about the weights of the third and fourth trouts.

Given the information provided, we can only express the earnings in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):

Answer: Wei will earn \( 0.25 \times (136 + x + y) \) dollars, where \( x \) and \( y \) are the weights of the third and fourth trouts, respectively.",0

44,Ravi was a pen pal with 14 people. He stopped being penpals with 4 of them. They each send 3 letters a week that are 6 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 8 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,"Ravi is penpals with 14-4=10 people
Thus he gets 10*3=30 letters a week
So he writes 30*6=180 pages a week
So he writes for 180*8=1440 minutes a week
So he writes 1440/60=24 hours a week
#### 24","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Ravi spends writing letters each week. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Ravi currently has:**
   - Ravi originally had 14 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
   - Therefore, he currently has \(14 - 4 = 10\) pen pals.

2. **Calculate the number of pages Ravi writes each week:**
   - Each of the 4 former pen pals sends 3 letters a week.
   - Each letter is 6 pages long.
   - So, each former pen pal sends \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pages per week.
   - Since Ravi responds in kind, he also writes 18 pages per former pen pal each week.
   - For all 4 former pen pals, he writes \(4 \times 18 = 72\) pages per week.

3. **Calculate the time spent writing these pages:**
   - Ravi writes a page every 8 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 72 pages, he spends \(72 \times 8 = 576\) minutes.

4. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, \(576 \div 60 = 9.6\) hours.

Therefore, Ravi spends 9.6 hours writing letters each week.

45,"A new infection infects 18 people. Every day, each infected person infects 6 others. How many people are infected after 3 days?","On the first day, the original 18 people infect 6 people each, so 18 * 6 = 108 more people are infected.
There are 18 + 108 = 126 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 126 * 6 = 756 more people are infected.
There are 126 + 756 = 882 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 882 * 6 = 5292 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 882 + 5292 = 6174 infected people after 3 days.
#### 6174","To solve this problem, we need to understand how the infection spreads over the course of several days. We can break down the infection spread using a chain of thought approach.

**Step 1: Initial Infection**

- On day 0, we have 1 new infection.
- This initial infected person infects 18 people on the first day.

**Step 2: Infection on Day 1**

- On the first day, there are 18 newly infected individuals.
- These 18 people each infect 6 others.
- Calculating the number of new infections on day 1:  
  \(18 \times 6 = 108\) new infections.

- Total infected by the end of day 1:  
  Initial 1 + 18 (from day 0) + 108 (new on day 1) = 127 people.

**Step 3: Infection on Day 2**

- On the second day, the 108 people infected on day 1 each infect 6 others.
- Calculating the number of new infections on day 2:  
  \(108 \times 6 = 648\) new infections.

- Total infected by the end of day 2:  
  127 (end of day 1) + 648 (new on day 2) = 775 people.

**Step 4: Infection on Day 3**

- On the third day, the 648 people infected on day 2 each infect 6 others.
- Calculating the number of new infections on day 3:  
  \(648 \times 6 = 3888\) new infections.

- Total infected by the end of day 3:  
  775 (end of day 2) + 3888 (new on day 3) = 4663 people.

Therefore, after 3 days, a total of 4663 people are infected.

If the force to move the van is 2% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?","His 3 friends weigh 75*3=225 kilograms
So the total weight of the van and everything is 2850+425+225=3500 kilograms
So he needs to generate 3500*0.02=70 kilograms
#### 70","To determine the force Hiroshi needs to push the van, we must first calculate the total weight of the van, groceries, and the young friends inside it. Then, we'll calculate 2% of that total weight, as that percentage is the force required to move the van.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the young friends:**
   - Each friend weighs 75 kilograms.
   - There are 3 friends.
   - Total weight of friends = 3 friends × 75 kg/friend = 225 kg.

2. **Determine the total weight inside the van:**
   - Weight of the van = 2850 kg.
   - Weight of the groceries = 425 kg.
   - Total weight of the friends = 225 kg.
   - Total weight inside the van = 2850 kg + 425 kg + 225 kg.

3. **Calculate the total weight:**
   - Total weight inside the van = 2850 kg + 425 kg + 225 kg = 3500 kg.

4. **Calculate the force needed to move the van:**
   - The force required is 2% of the total weight.
   - Force = 2% of 3500 kg = 0.02 × 3500 kg.

5. **Compute the force:**
   - Force = 0.02 × 3500 kg = 70 kg.

Since force is typically expressed in newtons (N), and assuming a gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m/s², we convert the weight-based force to newtons:

6. **Convert the force from kilograms to newtons:**
   - Force in newtons = 70 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 686 N.

He also got a 390 * 4 = €1560 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of July.
At the end of July, he earned 1680 + 1560 = €3240.
#### 3240","To determine how much money Diego made in July, let's break down the calculation step-by-step.

1. **Calculate Diego's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Diego works 10 hours a day, 3 days a week.
   - Total hours worked per week = 10 hours/day × 3 days/week = 30 hours/week.
   - Hourly wage = €14.
   - Weekly earnings from hourly wage = 30 hours/week × €14/hour = €420.

2. **Add the weekly bonus to Diego's weekly earnings:**
   - Weekly bonus = €390.
   - Total weekly earnings including bonus = €420 (hourly earnings) + €390 (bonus) = €810.

3. **Determine the number of weeks in July:**
   - July has 31 days.
   - A month typically has about 4.345 weeks (since 365 days in a year divided by 52 weeks ≈ 7 days/week gives about 4.345 weeks per month).
   - For July, calculate the number of complete weeks Diego worked:
     - If we consider a 4-week month, Diego would work 4 weeks.
     - The remaining days in July are 31 - (4 weeks × 7 days/week) = 31 - 28 = 3 days.
     - Since Diego works 3 days a week, he can work an additional 1 day in those 3 remaining days.

4. **Calculate total earnings for July:**
   - Earnings for 4 full weeks = 4 weeks × €810/week = €3,240.
   - Earnings for the additional 1 day (10 hours) = 10 hours × €14/hour = €140.
   - Total earnings for July = €3,240 + €140 = €3,380.

Answer: €3,380",3380
48,Arjun is rolling a 12-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 9 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 9 / 12 = 75%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 75% - 25% = 50%.
#### 50","To solve this problem, we need to determine two probabilities and then compare them to find how much more likely one event is than the other. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Probability of Rolling a Number Greater than 3:**

   A 12-sided die has numbers from 1 to 12. We need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

   - Numbers greater than 3 are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
   - Total numbers greater than 3 = 9.
   - Total possible outcomes when rolling the die = 12.

   \[
   \text{Probability of rolling a number greater than 3} = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

2. **Probability of Rolling Two Odd Numbers in a Row:**

   First, determine the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll.

   - Odd numbers on a 12-sided die are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
   - Total odd numbers = 6.
   - Total possible outcomes = 12.

   \[
   \text{Probability of rolling an odd number} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is:

   \[
   \text{Probability of two odd numbers in a row} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

3. **Comparing the Probabilities:**

   We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = \(\frac{3}{4}\).
   - Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row = \(\frac{1}{4}\).

   The difference in probabilities is:

   \[
   \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

4. **Expressing the Difference as a Percentage:**

   To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row:

   \[
   \text{Percentage difference} = \left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}}\right) \times 100\% = 2 \times 100\% = 200\%
   \]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Arjun rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

Answer: 200%",200
49,"Gabriel caught 5 trouts last Friday, the first trout he caught weighs 43 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 45 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 28 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs ¥0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Gabriel will earn 43 x ¥0.5 = ¥21.5 from the first trout.
He will earn 45 x ¥0.5 = ¥22.5 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 5-2 = 3. He will earn 28 x ¥0.5 = ¥14.0 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 14.0 = =42.0
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is ¥21.5 + ¥22.5 + ¥42.0= ¥86.
#### 86","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the trout Gabriel caught and then calculate the earnings based on the given price per kilogram. Here’s the step-by-step chain of thought:

1. **Determine the weights of the trouts given:**
   - Weight of the first trout = 43 kilograms
   - Weight of the second trout = 45 kilograms
   - Weight of the last trout = 28 kilograms

2. **Find the number of trouts for which weights are not given explicitly:**
   - Gabriel caught a total of 5 trouts.
   - Weights are provided for 3 trouts (first, second, and last).
   - Therefore, weights for the 2 remaining trouts are not provided.

3. **Assume average weight for missing trouts:**
   - Since no weight information is provided for the 3rd and 4th trouts, we can make an assumption. Without additional information, the reasonable assumption is that the average trouts could weigh similar to the known weights. However, since the problem does not specify, and trouts vary in weight, it's only correct to account for the specifically mentioned weights unless instructed otherwise.

4. **Sum up weights of known trouts:**
   - Total weight = 43 kg (first) + 45 kg (second) + 28 kg (last) = 116 kilograms

5. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - Cost per kilogram = ¥0.5
   - Total earnings = Total weight × Cost per kilogram
   - Total earnings = 116 kg × ¥0.5/kg = ¥58

Thus, Gabriel will earn:

Answer: ¥58",58
