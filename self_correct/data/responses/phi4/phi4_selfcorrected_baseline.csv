0,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 175 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 1975 and you have already consumed 925 calories?","If the total calorie target is 1975 and I have consumed 925 calories then I have 1975-925 = 1050 calories left to eat
If each serving of breads has 175 calories and I only have 1050 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1050/175 of a serving = 6 of a serving
We also know that a 300 ounces bag of breads has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 ounces/5 = 60 ounces
If I can only eat 6 of a serving, then I can eat only 60 * 6 = 60*6 = 360 ounces
#### 360","To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the remaining calorie allowance:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 1975 calories.
   - You have already consumed 925 calories.
   - Remaining calorie allowance = 1975 calories - 925 calories = 1050 calories.

2. **Determine the calories per serving of bread:**
   - According to the nutritional info, one serving of bread contains 175 calories.

3. **Calculate the number of servings you can consume with the remaining calorie allowance:**
   - Number of servings you can consume = Remaining calorie allowance / Calories per serving
   - Number of servings = 1050 calories / 175 calories per serving = 6 servings.

4. **Determine how much of the bread is used per serving:**
   - The 300-ounce bag has 5 servings.
   - Ounces per serving = Total ounces / Number of servings
   - Ounces per serving = 300 ounces / 5 servings = 60 ounces per serving.

5. **Calculate the total ounces you can consume:**
   - Since you can consume 6 servings and each serving is 60 ounces:
   - Total ounces you can eat = Number of servings you can consume * Ounces per serving
   - Total ounces = 6 servings * 60 ounces per serving = 360 ounces.

6. **Check if the limit of the bag allows for this consumption:**
   - The bag contains only 300 ounces, but you calculated 360 ounces, which implies you can only consume as much as the bag allows.

7. **Determine the actual ounces you can consume from the bag:**
   - Since the bag contains only 300 ounces, the maximum ounces you can actually consume from the bag, even if you could consume more servings calorie-wise, is 300 ounces.

Answer: 300 ounces",300,"Certainly! Let's go through the problem again with a careful step-by-step approach.

1. **Identify the remaining calorie allowance:**
   - Daily calorie target = 1975 calories
   - Calories already consumed = 925 calories
   - Remaining calorie allowance = 1975 - 925 = 1050 calories

2. **Determine the calories per serving of bread:**
   - Calories per serving = 175 calories

3. **Calculate the number of servings you can consume with the remaining calorie allowance:**
   - Number of servings you can consume = Remaining calorie allowance / Calories per serving
   - Number of servings = 1050 / 175 = 6 servings

4. **Determine how much of the bread is used per serving:**
   - The 300-ounce bag has 5 servings.
   - Ounces per serving = Total ounces / Number of servings
   - Ounces per serving = 300 ounces / 5 servings = 60 ounces per serving

5. **Calculate the total ounces you can consume:**
   - You can consume 6 servings, and each serving is 60 ounces.
   - Total ounces you can eat = Number of servings you can consume * Ounces per serving
   - Total ounces = 6 servings * 60 ounces per serving = 360 ounces

6. **Check if the limit of the bag allows for this consumption:**
   - The bag contains only 300 ounces, but you calculated 360 ounces.

7. **Determine the actual ounces you can consume from the bag:**
   - Since the bag contains only 300 ounces, the maximum ounces you can actually consume from the bag is limited to the total amount available, which is 300 ounces.

8. **Adjust the servings based on the bag's limit:**
   - Since the bag only has 300 ounces, and each serving is 60 ounces, the maximum servings you can actually have from the bag is 300 ounces / 60 ounces per serving = 5 servings.

9. **Verify calorie intake with the actual servings from the bag:**
   - Calories from 5 servings = 5 servings * 175 calories per serving = 875 calories

10. **Ensure this fits within your calorie allowance:**
    - You need 1050 calories, and 5 servings provide 875 calories, which is within your remaining calorie allowance.

3,"In a 100-item quiz, 30% of the questions are physics, and the rest are equally divided as economics and literature questions. If Olivia is sure to get 30% of the physics questions, and 1/2 of the economics and literature questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?","The economics and literature questions comprises 100% - 30% = 70% of the quiz.
There are 100 questions x 30/100 = 30 physics questions.
There are a total of 100 questions x 70/100 = 70 economics and literature questions.
If Olivia is sure to get 30% of the physics questions, then this means she is sure of her 30 questions x 30/100 = 9 points.
From the economics and literature questions, she is sure to get 1/2 of it correctly so that is 70 questions * 1/2 = 35 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 9 points + 35 points = 44 points in her quiz.
#### 44","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions belong to each subject and how many Olivia is sure to answer correctly. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of questions for each subject:**
   - According to the problem, the quiz contains 100 questions in total.
   - 30% of the questions are physics questions. So, the number of physics questions is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of physics questions} = 0.30 \times 100 = 30
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions for economics and literature:**
   - The total number of questions that are not physics is \(100 - 30 = 70\).
   - These 70 questions are equally divided between economics and literature.
   - Therefore, the number of questions for each (economics and literature) is:
     \[
     \text{Number of economics questions} = \text{Number of literature questions} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
     \]

3. **Determine how many questions Olivia is sure to get correct:**
   - **Physics questions:**
     - Olivia is sure to get 30% of the physics questions correct.
     - Thus, the number of physics questions she knows is:
       \[
       \text{Physics questions correct} = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
       \]

   - **Economics questions:**
     - Olivia is sure to get half of the economics questions correct.
     - Therefore, the number of economics questions she knows is:
       \[
       \text{Economics questions correct} = \frac{1}{2} \times 35 = 17.5
       \]
     - Since the number of questions answered must be whole, we assume Olivia is certain to get 17 questions correct (typically rounding down in such scenarios).

   - **Literature questions:**
     - Similarly, Olivia is sure to get half of the literature questions correct.
     - Thus, the number of literature questions she knows is:
       \[
       \text{Literature questions correct} = \frac{1}{2} \times 35 = 17.5
       \]
     - Again, assuming Olivia is certain to get 17 questions correct.

4. **Calculate the total number of questions Olivia is sure to get correct:**
   - Add the correct answers for each subject to find the total number of questions she is sure to get right:

The weight of all the feed is 18 + 70 + 380 + 1452 = 1920 kgs.
Thus, the farmer needs 1920 / 120 = 16 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 16","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of each type of feed and the number of trips required by the farmer's truck to transport all the feed. Here's how we can compute it step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the wheats:**
   - Number of boxes of wheats: 6
   - Weight per box: 3 kg
   - Total weight of wheats = 6 boxes × 3 kg/box = 18 kg

2. **Calculate the total weight of the beets:**

6. **Determine the number of trips needed:**
   - Truck capacity per trip: 120 kg
   - Number of trips required = Total weight / Truck capacity
   - Number of trips required = 1788 kg / 120 kg/trip = 14.9 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a partial trip, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 15 trips.

Answer: 15",15,"Let's carefully go through the solution again step-by-step to ensure accuracy:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the wheats:**
   - Number of boxes of wheats: 6
   - Weight per box: 3 kg
   - Total weight of wheats = 6 boxes × 3 kg/box = 18 kg

2. **Calculate the total weight of the beets:**
   - Number of bags of beets: 14
   - Weight per bag: 5 kg
   - Total weight of beets = 14 bags × 5 kg/bag = 70 kg

3. **Calculate the total weight of the oats:**
   - Number of packs of oats: 30 (Note: The original problem states 33, but the calculation uses 30. Let's correct it.)
   - Weight per pack: 44 kg
   - Total weight of oats = 33 packs × 44 kg/pack = 1452 kg

4. **Calculate the total weight of the hay:**
   - Number of sacks of hay: 20
   - Weight per sack: 19 kg
   - Total weight of hay = 20 sacks × 19 kg/sack = 380 kg

7,Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years. Xavier's uncle saw the Comet when he was 31 years old. Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. How old was Xavier when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Xavier saw the Comet for the second time when he was 31 years * 3= 93 years old.
Comet Hyakutake can be seen every 80 years, so Xavier saw the comet for the first time when he was 93 years - 80 years = 13 years old.
#### 13","To solve this problem, we'll go through each step logically, based on the given information.

1. **Identify the age at which uncle saw the comet**:  
   Xavier's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.

2. **Calculate the age of the uncle when Xavier saw the comet the second time**:  
   It's stated that Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet.  
   Uncle's age when he saw the comet = 31.  
   Therefore, the age of Xavier when he saw the comet the second time = 3 × 31 = 93.

3. **Determine the interval between comet sightings**:  
   Since Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years, the time between the uncle's sighting and Xavier's second sighting is 80 years.

4. **Calculate the uncle's age at the second sighting**:  
   Uncle's age when the second sighting occurred = 31 (his age at the first sighting) + 80 (years between sightings) = 111 years old.

5. **Calculate Xavier's age difference between the two sightings**:  
   Xavier was 93 when he saw the comet the second time.  
   To find how many years after the uncle's first sighting this second sighting occurred, subtract 80 years from Xavier's age at the second sighting:  
   Xavier's age during the second sighting - uncle's age increase = 93 - (111 - 31) = 93 - 80 = 13.

6. **Determine Xavier's age at the first sighting**:  
   Since there are 80 years between sightings and Xavier was 13 years younger at the first sighting, subtract 80 years minus 13 from his age at the second sighting:  
   Xavier's age at the first sighting = 93 (age at the second sighting) - 80 + 13 = 26.

Therefore, Xavier was 26 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Answer: 26",26,"Certainly! Let's go through the solution step by step, checking for any mistakes and ensuring clarity:

1. **Identify the age at which uncle saw the comet**:  
   Xavier's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.

2. **Calculate the age of Xavier when he saw the comet the second time**:  
   Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet.  
   Uncle's age when he saw the comet = 31.  
   Therefore, Xavier's age at the second sighting = 3 × 31 = 93.

3. **Determine the interval between comet sightings**:  
   Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years, so the time between the uncle's sighting and Xavier's second sighting is 80 years.

4. **Calculate the uncle's age at the second sighting**:  
   Uncle's age during the second sighting = 31 (his age at the first sighting) + 80 = 111 years old.

5. **Calculate the time difference between Xavier's two sightings**:  
   Xavier's age during the second sighting = 93.  
   The time between the two comet sightings is 80 years.

6. **Determine Xavier's age at the first sighting**:  
   Since there are 80 years between sightings, subtract 80 from Xavier's age at the second sighting to find his age at the first sighting:  
   Xavier's age at the first sighting = 93 (age at the second sighting) - 80 = 13.

Therefore, Xavier was 13 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 7-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty five 43-pound packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys sixteen 16-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 110 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of wheats.
He is buying 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of cucumbers.
He is buying 16 * 16 = 256 pounds of hay.
He is buying 35 * 43 = 1505 pounds of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 25 + 84 + 256 + 1505 = 1870 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 1870 / 110 = 17 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 17","To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and then divide it by the carrying capacity of the truck.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the wheats:**

   - Total weight of wheats = 5 boxes × 5 pounds/box = 25 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the cucumbers:**
   - The farmer buys 12 bags of cucumbers, each weighing 7 pounds.
   - Total weight of cucumbers = 12 bags × 7 pounds/bag = 84 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the oats:**
   - The farmer buys 35 packs of oats, each weighing 43 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 35 packs × 43 pounds/pack = 1,505 pounds.

4. **Calculate the total weight of the hay:**

14,The vending machines sell popcorn for 30 cents and crackers for 125 cents. Qasim spent $1100 and got 5 bags of popcorn and had 6% of his money left in change. How many crackers did he buy?,"Qasim got $66.0 in change because 1100 x 6/100 = 66
Qasim spent $1034 because 1100 - 66 = 1034
Qasim spent $1.5 on popcorn because 5 x 0.3 = 1.5
Qasim spent 1032.5 on crackers because 1034.0 - 1.5 = 1032.5
Qasim bought 826 crackers because 1032.5 / 1.25 = 826
#### 826","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using a chain of thought:

1. **Understand the total money spent and remaining:**
   - Qasim spent $1100 and had 6% of his money left in change.
   - This means he spent 94% of his money (100% - 6% = 94%).

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Qasim had initially:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total amount of money Qasim had.
   - He spent 94% of \( x \), which equals $1100.
   - Therefore, \( 0.94x = 1100 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1100}{0.94} = 1170.21
   \]
   - So, Qasim initially had $1170.21.

4. **Calculate the amount of money left as change:**
   - 6% of \( x \) is left as change.
   - Change = \( 0.06 \times 1170.21 = 70.21 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the items bought:**
   - Total cost of items = Initial money - Change
   - Total cost = \( 1170.21 - 70.21 = 1100 \).

6. **Calculate the cost of popcorn:**
   - Popcorn costs 30 cents per bag.
   - Qasim bought 5 bags of popcorn.
   - Total cost of popcorn = \( 5 \times 30 = 150 \) cents.

7. **Convert the cost of popcorn to dollars:**
   - 150 cents = $1.50.

8. **Calculate the remaining money spent on crackers:**
   - Total money spent on crackers = Total cost - Cost of popcorn
   - Money spent on crackers = \( 1100 - 1.50 = 1098.50 \).

9. **Calculate the number of crackers bought:**
   - Crackers cost 125 cents each.
   - Convert $1098.50 to cents: \( 1098.50 \times 100 = 109850 \) cents.
   - Number of crackers = \( \frac{109850}{125} = 878.8 \).

10. **Since Qasim can only buy whole crackers, round down:**
    - Number of crackers = 878.

15,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 150 calories per serving. If a 200 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 800 calories?","If the total calorie target is 2300 and I have consumed 800 calories then I have 2300-800 = 1500 calories left to eat
If each serving of cookies has 150 calories and I only have 1500 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1500/150 of a serving = 10 of a serving
We also know that a 200 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 200 oz/5 = 40 oz
If I can only eat 10 of a serving, then I can eat only 40 * 10 = 40*10 = 400 oz
#### 400","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of cookies you can consume to stay within your daily calorie target. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine Remaining Calorie Allowance**: 
   - You have a daily calorie target of 2300 calories.
   - You have already consumed 800 calories.
   - Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:
     \[
     2300 \text{ calories (target)} - 800 \text{ calories (already consumed)} = 1500 \text{ calories remaining}
     \]

2. **Determine Calories per Ounce of Cookies**:
   - Each serving of cookies is 150 calories.
   - The bag contains 5 servings and weighs 200 ounces.
   - Calculate the ounces per serving:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 40 \text{ ounces per serving}
     \]
   - Therefore, each ounce of cookies contains:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ calories}}{40 \text{ ounces}} = 3.75 \text{ calories per ounce}
     \]

3. **Determine How Many Ounces You Can Eat**:
   - With 1500 calories remaining, calculate how many ounces of cookies you can consume:
     \[
     \frac{1500 \text{ calories}}{3.75 \text{ calories per ounce}} = 400 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Check Against the Bag Size**:
   - The bag contains only 200 ounces.
   - Since 400 ounces exceeds the bag size, you can only consume up to 200 ounces, which is the total available in the bag.

Therefore, you can eat up to 200 ounces of cookies without exceeding your calorie target.

Answer: 200 oz",200,"Let's carefully revisit the solution to ensure accuracy:

1. **Determine Remaining Calorie Allowance**: 
   - Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.

   - Each serving of cookies is 150 calories.
   - The bag contains 5 servings and weighs 200 ounces.
   - Calculate the ounces per serving:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 40 \text{ ounces per serving}
     \]
   - Therefore, each ounce of cookies contains:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ calories}}{40 \text{ ounces}} = 3.75 \text{ calories per ounce}
     \]

3. **Determine How Many Ounces You Can Eat**:
   - With 1500 calories remaining, calculate how many ounces of cookies you can consume:
     \[
     \frac{1500 \text{ calories}}{3.75 \text{ calories per ounce}} = 400 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Check Against the Bag Size**:
   - The bag contains only 200 ounces.
   - Since 400 ounces exceeds the bag size, you can only consume up to 200 ounces, which is the total available in the bag.

Thus, the maximum amount of cookies you can eat without exceeding your calorie target is limited by the bag size.

17,"A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of hay, wheats, beets and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys six 7-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys thirteen 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty four 41-kg packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys eighteen 17-kg sacks. If his farm truck can carry 140 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6 * 7 = 42 kgs of oats.
He is buying 13 * 6 = 78 kgs of beets.
He is buying 18 * 17 = 306 kgs of wheats.
He is buying 34 * 41 = 1394 kgs of hay.
The weight of all the feed is 42 + 78 + 306 + 1394 = 1820 kgs.
Thus, the farmer needs 1820 / 140 = 13 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

4. **Calculate the total weight of the wheats:**
   - The farmer buys eighteen 17-kg sacks of wheats.
   - Total weight of wheats = 18 sacks × 17 kg/sack = 306 kg.

5. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**
   - Total weight = weight of oats + weight of beets + weight of hay + weight of wheats
   - Total weight = 42 kg + 78 kg + 1,394 kg + 306 kg = 1,820 kg.

6. **Determine the number of trips needed:**
   - The truck can carry 140 kg per trip.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   - Number of trips = 1,820 kg ÷ 140 kg/trip = 13 trips with a remainder.

7. **Account for any remainder:**
   - 1,820 kg ÷ 140 kg/trip = 13 trips with a remainder of 20 kg.
   - Since there is a remainder, an additional trip is needed for the remaining 20 kg.

Luis spent 1162.0 on cookies because 1164.0 - 2.0 = 1162.0
Luis bought 1162 cookies because 1162.0 / 1.0 = 1162
#### 1162","To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of money Luis initially had:**

   Luis had 3% of his money left after spending ₺1200. Therefore, the ₺1200 he spent is 97% of his initial total money.

   \[
   0.97 \times \text{Initial Money} = 1200
   \]

   Solving for the Initial Money:

   \[
   \text{Initial Money} = \frac{1200}{0.97} \approx 1237.11
   \]

   Since money is typically in whole cents, Luis initially had ₺1237.11, which is 123711 cents.

2. **Calculate the amount of money Luis spent:**

   Luis spent ₺1200, which is 120000 cents.

3. **Calculate the cost of the crackers:**

   Luis bought 4 bags of crackers, each costing 50 cents.

   \[
   \text{Cost of crackers} = 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining money spent on cookies:**

   Subtract the cost of the crackers from the total money spent to find out how much was spent on cookies.

   \[
   \text{Money spent on cookies} = 120000 - 200 = 119800 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of cookies bought:**

   Each cookie costs 100 cents. Therefore, the number of cookies Luis bought is:

   \[
   \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{119800}{100} = 1198
   \]

Thus, Luis bought 1198 cookies.

Answer: 1198",1198,"Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem using the Chain of Thought strategy to ensure the calculations are correct.

1. **Determine the total initial money Luis had:**

   Luis spent ₺1200, which is 97% of his initial money, since he had 3% left.

   \[
   0.97 \times \text{Initial Money} = 1200
   \]

   Solving for the Initial Money:

   \[
   \text{Initial Money} = \frac{1200}{0.97} \approx 1237.1134
   \]

   Converting to cents, Luis initially had 123711.34 cents. Since he can't have a fraction of a cent, we round it to 123711 cents.

2. **Calculate the amount of money Luis had left as change:**

   Luis had 3% of his initial money left.

   \[
   \text{Change} = 0.03 \times 123711 = 3711.33 \text{ cents}
   \]

   Rounding to the nearest whole cent, he had 3711 cents as change.

3. **Calculate the total money spent:**

   Subtract the change from the initial amount to find the total money spent:

   \[
   \text{Total Money Spent} = 123711 - 3711 = 120000 \text{ cents}
   \]

   This confirms that Luis spent 120000 cents.

4. **Calculate the cost of the crackers:**

   Luis bought 4 bags of crackers, each costing 50 cents.

   \[
   \text{Cost of crackers} = 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining money spent on cookies:**

   Subtract the cost of the crackers from the total money spent to find out how much was spent on cookies.

   \[
   \text{Money spent on cookies} = 120000 - 200 = 119800 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of cookies bought:**

   Each cookie costs 100 cents. Therefore, the number of cookies Luis bought is:

Elena already owns 10 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €4 at the store, how much money will Elena spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Elena's flower bed is 182 meters / 13.0 meters per plant = 14 plants needed.
Elena needs to buy 14 plants - 10 plants = 4 plants needed to purchase.
Elena will spend 4 plants * €4 = €16.
#### 16","To determine how much money Elena will spend at the store, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total space each plant occupies**:
   - Each plant grows 5 meters wide.
   - There needs to be 13.0 meters of space between each plant.
   - Therefore, the total space occupied by one plant and the space after it is \(5 + 13 = 18\) meters.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed**:
   - The entire flower bed is 182 meters long.
   - To find out how many such 18-meter sections fit into 182 meters, we divide 182 by 18:
     \[
     \frac{182}{18} \approx 10.11
     \]
   - Since Elena cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she will need 11 plants in total to cover the entire length.

3. **Determine how many more plants Elena needs to buy**:
   - Elena already owns 10 plants.
   - She needs a total of 11 plants.
   - Therefore, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is \(11 - 10 = 1\).

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants**:
   - Each plant costs €4.
   - Elena needs to buy 1 more plant.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(1 \times 4 = €4\).

Emma already owns 13 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €13 at the store, how much money will Emma spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Emma's flower bed is 204 feet / 12.75 feet per plant = 16 plants needed.
Emma needs to buy 16 plants - 13 plants = 3 plants needed to purchase.
Emma will spend 3 plants * €13 = €39.
#### 39","To determine how much money Emma will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to perform the following calculations step by step:

1. **Determine the total space required for each plant, including the gap:**
   - Every flower grows 7 feet wide and requires 12.75 feet of space between neighboring plants.
   - Thus, the total space required per plant is:  
     \[
     \text{Space per plant} = 7 \, \text{feet (plant width)} + 12.75 \, \text{feet (interval)} = 19.75 \, \text{feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed to fill the flower bed:**
   - The length of the flower bed is 204 feet.
   - We need to find out how many 19.75-foot segments can fit into 204 feet:
   \[
   \text{Number of plants needed (total)} = \frac{204 \, \text{feet}}{19.75 \, \text{feet/plant}} \approx 10.33

37,Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years. Xavier's uncle saw the Comet when he was 31 years old. Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. How old was Xavier when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Xavier saw the Comet for the second time when he was 31 years * 3= 93 years old.
Comet Hyakutake can be seen every 80 years, so Xavier saw the comet for the first time when he was 93 years - 80 years = 13 years old.
#### 13","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age Xavier's uncle was when he saw the comet:**
   - Xavier's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.

2. **Determine the age Xavier was when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Xavier was \(3 \times 31 = 93\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the interval between the two sightings:**
   - Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years.
   - Therefore, the time between the uncle's sighting and Xavier's second sighting is 80 years.

4. **Determine Xavier's age during the uncle's sighting:**
   - If Xavier was 93 years old at his second sighting, and this was 80 years after his uncle's sighting, then Xavier was \(93 - 80 = 13\) years old at the time of his uncle's sighting.

5. **Determine the number of years between Xavier's first sighting and the uncle's sighting:**
   - Since Xavier saw the comet again 80 years after his uncle, and he was 13 at that time, the first sighting must have occurred before he was 13.
   - Let \(x\) be Xavier's age during his first sighting. The difference in years between his first sighting and the uncle's sighting is \(31 - x\).

6. **Determine the interval between Xavier's first and second sightings:**
   - Since the comet reappears every 80 years, the difference in years between Xavier's first and second sightings is also 80.
   - Therefore, \(93 - x = 80\).

7. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(93 - x = 80\)
   - \(x = 93 - 80\)
   - \(x = 13\).

8. **Determine Xavier's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since \(x = 13\) represents his age at the time of the uncle's sighting, and we need to find his age at his first sighting, we need to consider the interval between the two sightings.
   - The interval between the uncle's sighting and Xavier's first sighting is \(31 - x = 31 - 13 = 18\) years.
   - Therefore, Xavier was \(13 - 18 = -5\) years old at his first sighting, which means he was not born yet.

9. **Determine Xavier's birth year relative to the comet's cycle:**
   - Since Xavier was not born during his first sighting, he was born 18 years after his first sighting.
   - Therefore, he saw the comet for the first time \(18\) years after his birth.

10. **Calculate Xavier's age at his first sighting:**
    - Since Xavier was born 18 years after his first sighting, he was \(0\) years old at his birth, and he saw the comet for the first time \(18\) years later.
    - Therefore, Xavier was \(18\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Answer: 18",18,"Let's carefully go through the problem and solve it step by step to find the correct answer.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Initial Information:**
   - Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 80 years.
   - Xavier's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
   - Xavier saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet.

2. **Calculate Xavier's Age at Second Sighting:**
   - Uncle's age when he saw the comet: 31 years.
   - Xavier's age at second sighting: \(3 \times 31 = 93\) years.

3. **Determine the Interval Between Sightings:**
   - The comet reappears every 80 years.
   - Therefore, the interval between the uncle's sighting and Xavier's second sighting is 80 years.

4. **Determine Xavier's Age at Uncle's Sighting:**
   - If Xavier was 93 at his second sighting, and this was 80 years after his uncle's sighting, then:
   - Xavier's age at the uncle's sighting: \(93 - 80 = 13\) years.

5. **Determine Xavier's Age at First Sighting:**
   - Since the comet reappears every 80 years, the difference between Xavier's first and second sightings is also 80 years.
   - Let \(x\) be Xavier's age at his first sighting.
   - The equation for the second sighting is: \(x + 80 = 93\).

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x + 80 = 93\)
   - \(x = 93 - 80\)
   - \(x = 13\).

7. **Interpret the Results:**
   - Xavier was 13 years old at his uncle's sighting.
   - Since the comet reappears every 80 years, Xavier's first sighting must have been 80 years before his second sighting.
   - Therefore, Xavier was \(13 - 80 = -67\) years old at his first sighting, meaning he was not born yet.

8. **Determine Xavier's Birth Year Relative to the Comet's Cycle:**
   - Xavier was born 67 years after his first sighting.
   - Therefore, he saw the comet for the first time 67 years after his birth.

9. **Calculate Xavier's Age at His First Sighting:**
   - Since Xavier was born 67 years after his first sighting, he was \(0\) years old at his birth.
   - Therefore, Xavier was \(67\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Tara already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs $7 at the store, how much money will Tara spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Tara's flower bed is 196 meters / 12.25 meters per plant = 16 plants needed.
Tara needs to buy 16 plants - 11 plants = 5 plants needed to purchase.
Tara will spend 5 plants * $7 = $35.
#### 35","To find out how much money Tara will spend to fill up her flower bed with plants, we'll need to go through several steps:

1. **Determine the number of plants needed:**  
   Tara’s flower bed is 196 meters long, and she needs to leave 12.25 meters between each plant. We first calculate the space occupied by one plant and the space between the next plant:
   - Each plant takes up 7 meters of space along the length of the bed.
   - There is a 12.25-meter gap after each plant.
   - Therefore, the space occupied per plant (including the gap) is \( 7 + 12.25 = 19.25 \) meters.

2. **Calculate maximum number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**  
   To find out how many such spaces fit into 196 meters, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken per plant:
   \[
   \text{Number of spaces} = \frac{196}{19.25} \approx 10.1818
   \]
   Since Tara cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 10 spaces.

3. **Account for already owned plants:**  
   Tara already has 11 flowers. However, because the flower bed can only accommodate 10 plants (from the previous calculation), Tara does not need to buy any more plants. She already has more than enough to fill the flower bed.

4. **Calculate the cost of additional plants:**  
   Since no additional plants are needed, the cost for more plants is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of additional plants} = 0 \times 7 = 0 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Since Tara cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 10 plants.

3. **Account for already owned plants:**
   - Tara already owns 11 flowers, which is more than the 10 plants needed to fill the flower bed.

4. **Determine the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Since Tara already has 11 plants and only needs 10, she does not need to purchase any additional plants.

   - If Qasim had ₣40 left as change, then he spent:

   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 500 - 40 = 460 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn purchased:**
   - He bought 5 bags of popcorn, each costing 35 cents.

   \[
   \text{Cost of popcorn} = 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining amount spent on pretzels:**
   - Subtract the cost of popcorn from the total amount spent to find how much was spent on pretzels.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 460 - 175 = 285 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of pretzels purchased:**
   - Each pretzel costs 75 cents. To find out how many pretzels he bought, divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel.

   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{285}{75} = 3.8
   \]

   Since the number of pretzels must be a whole number, Qasim bought 3 pretzels.

6. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Calculate the total cost for 3 pretzels:

   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 pretzels} = 3 \times 75 = 225 \text{ cents}
   \]

   - Add the cost of 5 popcorns:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 175 + 225 = 400 \text{ cents}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total with change} = 400 + 40 = 440 \text{ cents}
   \]

   - Correct the calculation: The total should be 460 cents spent, so there was a mistake in verification. Recalculate:

   \[
   \text{Correct cost of pretzels} = 285 \text{ cents}
   \]

   - Recalculate the number of pretzels:

   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{285}{75} = 3.8 \rightarrow \text{round down to 3}
   \]

   - Verify:

   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 pretzels} = 3 \times 75 = 225 \text{ cents}
   \]

   - Total cost:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 175 + 225 = 400 \text{ cents}
   \]

   - Total with change:

   \[

43,"A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of oats, hay, cucumbers and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys five 5-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 7-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty five 43-pound packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys sixteen 16-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 110 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of wheats.
He is buying 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of cucumbers.
He is buying 16 * 16 = 256 pounds of hay.
He is buying 35 * 43 = 1505 pounds of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 25 + 84 + 256 + 1505 = 1870 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 1870 / 110 = 17 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 17","To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum them up. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Calculate the total weight of wheats:**
   - The farmer buys 5 boxes of wheats, each weighing 5 pounds.
   - Total weight of wheats = 5 boxes * 5 pounds/box = 25 pounds.

   - Xena's flower bed is 159 meters long.
   - Each flower plant occupies a width of 2 meters and needs 13.25 meters of space between each plant.
   - Therefore, the total space occupied by one plant, including the space between plants, is \(2 + 13.25 = 15.25\) meters.

2. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - To find out how many plants can fit, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies:
   \[
   \frac{159}{15.25} \approx 10.4262
   \]
   - Since Xena can only plant whole plants, she can fit 10 full plants in her flower bed.

3. **Determine the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Xena already owns 10 flowers.
   - Since she can fit 10 plants in total and she already owns 10, she does not need any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the cost:**
   - Since Xena does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost is:
   \[
   0 \times 14 = €0
   \]

Upon reviewing, the original solution was correct. Xena does not need to purchase any additional plants, so she will spend €0 at the store.",1,(1.1.2 Value of a known variable calculated again),1,4,False
47,There are 9 periods in the day for a normal student but Esteban has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 30 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends three-fourths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 9+3=12 classes a day
That means he spends 30*12=360 minutes per day in class
So he spends 360*6=2160 minutes a week
That means he spends 2160*3/4=1620 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 2160+1620+1620=5400 minutes per week
So he spends 5400/60=90 hours per week
#### 90","To find out how many hours per week Esteban spends learning, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of regular classes per day:**
   - There are 9 periods in the day for a normal student.
   - Each class period is 30 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in regular classes per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ periods} \times 30 \text{ minutes per period} = 270 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent in extra classes per day:**
   - Esteban takes 3 extra classes.
   - Each class is 30 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in extra classes per day is:
     \[
     3 \text{ extra classes} \times 30 \text{ minutes per class} = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent in classes per day:**
   - Add the time spent in regular classes and extra classes:
     \[
     270 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent in classes per week:**
   - Esteban goes to class for 6 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in classes per week is:
     \[
     360 \text{ minutes per day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - Esteban spends three-fourths of his weekly class minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, find three-fourths of the weekly class minutes:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 2160 \text{ minutes} = 1620 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - This total is split between Saturday and Sunday, so the time spent each day is:
     \[
     \frac{1620 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 810 \text{ minutes per day}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total extra learning time for the weekend:**
   - Add the learning time for both Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     810 \text{ minutes on Saturday} + 810 \text{ minutes on Sunday} = 1620 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Add the total class time for the week and the extra learning time for the weekend:
     \[
     2160 \text{ minutes (weekdays)} + 1620 \text{ minutes (weekend)} = 3780 \text{ minutes}
     \]

8. **Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{3780 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 63 \text{ hours}
     \]

Answer: 63 hours",63,"Let's carefully review and solve the problem step by step, ensuring accuracy in each step.

### Question Recap:
Esteban has 9 regular class periods, each 30 minutes long, plus 3 extra classes, each 30 minutes long, for 6 days a week. He spends three-fourths of his weekly class minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. We need to find out how many hours per week he spends learning.

### Revised Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of regular class minutes per day:**
   - Regular classes: \(9 \text{ periods} \times 30 \text{ minutes per period} = 270 \text{ minutes}\)

2. **Calculate the number of extra class minutes per day:**
   - Extra classes: \(3 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ minutes per class} = 90 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Calculate the total class minutes per day:**
   - Total class time: \(270 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the total class minutes per week (Monday to Friday and Saturday):**
   - Total class time for 6 days: \(360 \text{ minutes per day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 2160 \text{ minutes}\)

5. **Calculate the extra learning time on weekends:**
   - Three-fourths of the weekly class minutes: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 2160 \text{ minutes} = 1620 \text{ minutes}\)
   - This is split equally between Saturday and Sunday: \(\frac{1620 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 810 \text{ minutes per day}\)

6. **Calculate the total extra learning time for the weekend:**
   - Total weekend learning time: \(810 \text{ minutes on Saturday} + 810 \text{ minutes on Sunday} = 1620 \text{ minutes}\)

7. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Total learning time: \(2160 \text{ minutes (weekdays)} + 1620 \text{ minutes (weekend)} = 3780 \text{ minutes}\)

8. **Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(\frac{3780 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 63 \text{ hours}\)

48,The vending machines sell gum for 25 cents and popcorn for 75 cents. Ibrahim spent ₣500 and got 8 bags of gum and had 9% of his money left in change. How many popcorn did he buy?,"Ibrahim got ₣45.0 in change because 500 x 9/100 = 45
Ibrahim spent ₣455 because 500 - 45 = 455
Ibrahim spent ₣2.0 on gum because 8 x 0.25 = 2.0
Ibrahim spent 453.0 on popcorn because 455.0 - 2.0 = 453.0
Ibrahim bought 604 popcorn because 453.0 / 0.75 = 604
#### 604","To solve this problem, we begin by defining the costs and quantities involved in the purchases made by Ibrahim:

1. **Price of gum and popcorn:**
   - Gum costs 25 cents per bag.
   - Popcorn costs 75 cents per bag.

2. **Amount Ibrahim spent and had left:**
   - Ibrahim started with ₣500.
   - He spent 91% of his money (since 9% was left) on gum and popcorn.

3. **Calculating the total amount spent:**
   - Since he has 9% of his money left, he spent 91% of ₣500:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent} = 0.91 \times 500 = ₣455
     \]

4. **Cost of the gum:**
   - Ibrahim bought 8 bags of gum, so the total cost for gum is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of gum} = 8 \times 25 = ₣200
     \]

5. **Calculating the amount spent on popcorn:**
   - The amount spent on popcorn is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on gum:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on popcorn} = ₣455 - ₣200 = ₣255
     \]

6. **Calculating the number of popcorn bags:**
   - Each popcorn bag costs 75 cents, so the number of bags of popcorn bought is:
     \[
     \text{Number of popcorn bags} = \frac{₣255}{₣75} = 3.4
     \]

7. **Ensuring a whole number of bags:**
   - Since the number of popcorn bags must be a whole number, let's check calculations:
     - Since ₣255 divided by ₣75 equals exactly 3.4, it indicates a mistake in interpretation. Recheck:
     - ₣255 is divisible by ₣75 without a remainder:
       \[
       \frac{₣255}{₣75} = 3
       \]
   - Therefore, Ibrahim bought 3 bags of popcorn.

Answer: Ibrahim bought 3 bags of popcorn.",3,"Let's carefully revise the solution using the Chain of Thought strategy:

1. **Price of gum and popcorn:**
   - Gum costs 25 cents per bag.
   - Popcorn costs 75 cents per bag.

2. **Amount Ibrahim spent and had left:**
   - Ibrahim started with ₣500.
   - He had 9% of his money left, which means he spent 91% of his money.

3. **Calculating the total amount spent:**
   - Since he has 9% of his money left, he spent 91% of ₣500:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent} = 0.91 \times 500 = ₣455
     \]

4. **Cost of the gum:**
   - Ibrahim bought 8 bags of gum, so the total cost for gum is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of gum} = 8 \times 25 = ₣200
     \]

5. **Calculating the amount spent on popcorn:**
   - The amount spent on popcorn is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on gum:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on popcorn} = ₣455 - ₣200 = ₣255
     \]

6. **Calculating the number of popcorn bags:**
   - Each popcorn bag costs 75 cents, so the number of bags of popcorn bought is:
     \[
     \text{Number of popcorn bags} = \frac{₣255}{₣75} = 3.4
     \]
   - Since the number of popcorn bags must be a whole number, we need to ensure the calculation is correct.

7. **Re-evaluate the division:**
   - ₣255 divided by ₣75 should be a whole number:
     \[
     \frac{₣255}{₣75} = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, Ibrahim bought 3 bags of popcorn.
