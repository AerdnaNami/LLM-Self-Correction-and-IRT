0,"Amelia has a flower bed that is 195 meters long. Amelia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Amelia's flowers grow 3 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.0 meters between every plant. Amelia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs $4 at the store, how much money will Amelia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Amelia's flower bed is 195 meters / 13.0 meters per plant = 15 plants needed.
Amelia needs to buy 15 plants - 11 plants = 4 plants needed to purchase.
Amelia will spend 4 plants * $4 = $16.
#### 16","Step 1: Calculate the total space each plant plus spacing occupies. Each plant requires 3 meters, and each subsequent spacing is 13 meters. For \( n \) plants, the total length is \( 3n + 13(n - 1) \) meters.  
Step 2: Set the total length equal to the flower bed length: \( 3n + 13(n - 1) = 195 \).  
Step 3: Simplify the equation: \( 16n - 13 = 195 \).  
Step 4: Solve for \( n \): \( 16n = 208 \implies n = 13 \) plants needed in total.  
Step 5: Subtract the 11 plants Amelia already owns: \( 13 - 11 = 2 \) additional plants.  
Step 6: Calculate the cost: \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

1,Nia can peel 4 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 6 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 80 clams?,"First find how long it takes Nia to peel the clam: 80 clam / 4 clam/minute = 20 minutes
Then find how many batches of clam she needs to cook: 80 clam / 20 clam/batch = 4 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 4 batches * 6 minutes/batch = 24 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Nia spends: 24 minutes + 20 minutes = 44 minutes
#### 44","1. **Calculate peeling time for 80 clams:**  
   Nia peels 4 clams per minute.  
   Time to peel 80 clams = \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) minutes.

2. **Calculate sautéing time for 80 clams:**  
   She can sauté 20 clams in 6 minutes, so the rate is \( \frac{20}{6} \) clams per minute.  
   Time to sauté 80 clams = \( \frac{80}{20/6} = 80 \times \frac{6}{20} = 24 \) minutes.

3. **Determine overlapping of tasks:**  
   Sautéing can start as soon as 20 clams are peeled. Batches of 20 clams are sautéed sequentially, each taking 6 minutes.  

   - **Batch 1:** Starts at \( t = 5 \) minutes (when 20 clams are peeled), ends at \( t = 11 \) minutes.  
   - **Batch 2:** Starts at \( t = 11 \) minutes, ends at \( t = 17 \) minutes.  
   - **Batch 3:** Starts at \( t = 17 \) minutes, ends at \( t = 23 \) minutes.  
   - **Batch 4:** Starts at \( t = 20 \) minutes (when all 80 clams are peeled), ends at \( t = 26 \) minutes.  

4. **Total time:**  
   The last batch (Batch 4) ends at \( t = 26 \) minutes, which is the total time required to peel and sauté all 80 clams.

2,"Jamal works a 11-hour shift each day, 3 days a week. He earns $21 per hour and gets a $119 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Jamal make in December if the company performed very well for the whole month?","In a day, Jamal makes 11 * 21 = $231
If he works 3 days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 3 * 4= 12 days.
Since he makes $231 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 12 * 231= $2772.
He also got a 119 * 4 = $476 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of December.
At the end of December, he earned 2772 + 476 = $3248.
#### 3248","1. **Calculate weekly hours**: Jamal works 11 hours/day × 3 days/week = 33 hours/week.  
2. **Compute regular weekly pay**: 33 hours × $21/hour = $693/week.  
3. **Add weekly bonus**: $693 + $119 = $812/week.  
4. **Determine weeks in December**: December has 31 days, which equals 4 weeks and 3 days. Since Jamal works 3 days/week regardless of calendar alignment, the remaining 3 days count as a fifth week. Total weeks = 5.

The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.
#### 25","1. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a d6 die:**
   - Numbers greater than 3: 4, 5, 6 (3 outcomes).
   - Total possible outcomes: 6.
   - Probability = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - Even numbers on a d6: 2, 4, 6 (3 outcomes).
   - Probability of one even roll = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.
   - Since the rolls are independent, probability of two consecutive evens = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

3. **Determine how much more likely the first event is than the second:**
   - Difference in probabilities = 50% - 25% = 25%.
   - Percentage increase relative to the second event = (25% / 25%) × 100% = 100%.

4,"Kai works a 11-hour shift each day, 6 days a week. He earns €20 per hour and gets a €131 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Kai make in August if the company performed very well for the whole month?","In a day, Kai makes 11 * 20 = €220
If he works 6 days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 6 * 4= 24 days.
Since he makes €220 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 24 * 220= €5280.
He also got a 131 * 4 = €524 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of August.
At the end of August, he earned 5280 + 524 = €5804.
#### 5804","Step 1: Calculate Kai's weekly earnings from hourly wages.  
He works 11 hours/day, 6 days/week:  
6 days × 11 hours/day = 66 hours/week.  
Hourly earnings: 66 hours/week × €20/hour = €1,320/week.  

Step 2: Add the weekly bonus for good performance.  
Total weekly earnings: €1,320 + €131 = €1,451/week.  

Step 3: Determine the number of weeks in August.  
August has 31 days. Assuming a ""week"" refers to a 7-day period, August has 31 ÷ 7 ≈ 4.43 weeks. However, since bonuses are awarded per full week and the company performed well all month, we consider **5 weeks** (to account for partial weeks overlapping August).  

Step 4: Calculate total earnings for August.  
Total weekly earnings × 5 weeks:  
€1,451/week × 5 weeks = €7,255.

Andre spent 1356.5 on pretzels because 1358.0 - 1.5 = 1356.5
Andre bought 2713 pretzels because 1356.5 / 0.5 = 2713
#### 2713","₺1400 on gum and pretzels. He bought 5 bags of gum and ended up with 3% of his money left as change. We need to find out how many pretzels he bought.

First, let's understand the given information. The gum costs 30 cents per bag, and pretzels are 50 cents each. Andre's total money is ₺1400. Wait, the currency symbol is Turkish Lira (₺), but the prices are in cents. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, or perhaps the problem uses cents as units even though the currency is lira. But maybe the amounts are in cents? Like, maybe he spent 1400 cents, which would be 14 lira? Because 100 cents = 1 lira. That makes sense because 30 cents for gum is more reasonable than 30 lira. So converting everything to cents might be the way to go here.

So total money he had: 1400 lira. Wait, but if the problem says he spent 1400 lira and had 3% left, that's a bit different. Wait, the problem says ""Andre spent ₺1400 and got 5 bags of gum and had 3% of his money left in change."" Wait, so he spent 1400 lira, but then he had 3% left as change. Wait, that would mean that the total money he had was 1400 plus 3% of his original money. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me re-read the problem.

Wait, the problem says: ""Andre spent ₺1400 and got 5 bags of gum and had 3% of his money left in change."" Wait, this phrasing is a bit confusing. So he spent 1400 lira, but after spending that, he had 3% left. Wait, but that can't be, because if he spent 1400, then his total money would be 1400 plus the 3% left. Wait, maybe the problem is that he initially had a certain amount of money, spent some of it (totaling 1400 lira) on gum and pretzels, and the remaining money he has is 3% of his original amount. Hmm, that might make more sense.

Wait, maybe the total amount he had was X lira. He spent 1400 lira on gum and pretzels, and the change he received was 3% of X. So total expenditure is 1400, which is 97% of X. Because 3% was left as change. So X * 0.97 = 1400. Therefore, X = 1400 / 0.97 ≈ 1443.2989... But that seems a bit messy. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me read again.

Original problem: Andre spent ₺1400 and got 5 bags of gum and had 3% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?

Hmm, perhaps the 1400 lira is the total amount he had. He spent some of it, and the remaining is 3% of 1400, which is 42 lira. So total spent would be 1400 - 42 = 1358 lira. So he spent 1358 lira on gum and pretzels. Then, with that, he bought 5 bags of gum and some pretzels.

But the prices are in cents. Wait, 30 cents per gum and 50 cents per pretzel. So maybe we need to convert lira to cents? Because otherwise, if the prices are in lira, 30 lira for gum is expensive, but maybe that's how it is. Wait, but the problem says ""gum for 30 cents and pretzels for 50 cents"". So probably, the prices are in cents, and the total money is in lira. But 1 lira is 100 cents, right? So we need to convert everything to the same unit.

Wait, so let's clarify. Let's assume that the prices are in cents (so 0.30 lira per gum and 0.50 lira per pretzel). But the problem states that he spent 1400 lira. Wait, but if he bought 5 gums at 0.30 lira each, that's 5 * 0.30 = 1.50 lira. Then the pretzels would be 0.50 each. So spending 1400 lira on that would be a lot. So perhaps the problem actually uses cents as the unit. Maybe the entire problem is in cents. So 1400 cents, which is 14 lira. But the problem mentions ""₺1400"", which is 1400 lira, but maybe it's a typo and should be cents. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check again.

The problem states: ""The vending machines sell gum for 30 cents and pretzels for 50 cents. Andre spent ₺1400 and got 5 bags of gum and had 3% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?""

So the prices are in cents, but Andre spent 1400 lira. Wait, but in Turkey, 1 lira is 100 kurus (which are like cents). So perhaps the problem is mixing lira and kurus. But maybe the problem is intended to have all amounts in cents. Let's try to proceed under that assumption. Let's assume that the 1400 is in cents. So Andre spent 1400 cents (which is 14 lira) and had 3% left. Wait, but then 3% of 1400 cents is 42 cents. So he spent 1400 - 42 = 1358 cents. But he bought 5 gums at 30 cents each: 5*30=150 cents. The rest would be spent on pretzels. So 1358 - 150 = 1208 cents. Each pretzel is 50 cents, so 1208 /50 = 24.16. But you can't buy a fraction of a pretzel. So this can't be right. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the total money he had is 1400 lira, and the change he had is 3% of that, which is 42 lira. So he spent 1400 - 42 = 1358 lira. Then converting that to cents (1 lira = 100 cents), so 1358 lira is 135800 cents. The cost of 5 gums is 5*30 = 150 cents. So remaining money for pretzels is 135800 - 150 = 135650 cents. Each pretzel is 50 cents, so number of pretzels is 135650 /50 = 2713. But that's a huge number. That seems unrealistic. But maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have all amounts in cents. So the total money is 1400 cents. Then 3% of 1400 is 42 cents. So he spent 1400 -42 =1358 cents. Cost of gums: 5 *30=150. 1358-150=1208 cents left for pretzels. 1208/50=24.16. Which again is not a whole number. So this can't be. Therefore, there's a problem here.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the total amount he had was 1400 lira, he spent some amount, and the 3% is of the original amount. Let me model this properly.

Let’s let M be the total money he had initially. He spent some amount S on gum and pretzels, and received change of 3% of M. But the problem says he ""spent ₺1400 and got 5 bags of gum and had 3% of his money left in change."" Wait, perhaps he intended to spend 1400 lira, but after purchasing, he had 3% of his original money left. Wait, but this is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the total spent was 1400 lira, and the change he got back was 3% of that 1400. So the total money he had was 1400 + 3% of 1400 = 1400*1.03=1442 lira. But he spent 1400, and the change is 42. But then, how does the 5 gums and pretzels fit into this?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that he went to buy items, spent a total of 1400 lira, which resulted in him having 3% of his original money left. So total original money is X. After spending 1400, he has 0.03X left. Therefore:

X - 1400 = 0.03X

So X - 0.03X = 1400

0.97X =1400

X=1400/0.97≈1443.30 lira.

But then he spent 1400 lira, and had 43.30 lira left. Now, the cost of the gums and pretzels would be 1400 lira. But the gums are 30 cents each, pretzels 50 cents. So converting 1400 lira to cents would be 1400 *100=140,000 cents.

He bought 5 gums: 5*30=150 cents.

So remaining money spent on pretzels: 140,000 -150=139,850 cents.

Each pretzel is 50 cents: 139,850 /50=2797 pretzels. Which is an extremely high number. That can’t be right. So there must be a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's units are mixed. Let me try to think again. If the problem uses ""cents"" but writes ""₺"", which is lira, perhaps it's a mistake, and all amounts are in cents. So Andre spent 1400 cents (14 lira), bought 5 gums at 30 cents each, and had 3% of his original money left as change. So let's model that.

Let’s say original money is X cents. He spent (X - 3% of X) = 0.97X cents. But the problem says he spent 1400 cents. Wait, but that would mean 0.97X=1400, so X=1400/0.97≈1443.30 cents. Which is approximately 14.43 lira. But he spent 1400 cents (14 lira), and had 3% of his original money (which is 0.03*1443.30≈43.3 cents) left. So total spent is 1443.30 -43.3≈1400 cents, which checks out.

Now, the cost of 5 gums is 5*30=150 cents. The rest of the money spent (1400 -150=1250 cents) was on pretzels at 50 cents each. So number of pretzels is 1250 /50=25. But wait, 25*50=1250. Yes, that works. So the answer would be 25 pretzels. But wait, let's check all steps again to be sure.

Original money X cents. He spent 0.97X, which equals 1400 cents. Therefore:

0.97X =1400

X=1400 /0.97≈1443.2989≈1443.30 cents.

He had 3% left: 0.03*1443.30≈43.30 cents.

Total spent: 1443.30 -43.30=1400 cents, which matches.

Spending breakdown:

5 gums: 5*30=150 cents.

Remaining for pretzels:1400 -150=1250 cents.

Number of pretzels:1250 /50=25.

So the answer is 25.

But wait, let me check the calculation again. 1400 divided by 0.97. Let me compute that more accurately.

1400 /0.97:

Let's compute 1400 ÷ 0.97. Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimal: 140000 ÷97.

97*1443 = 97*(1400+43) =97*1400=135800; 97*43=4171. Total 135800+4171=139,971. That's 97*1443=139,971. But 140,000 -139,971=29. So 140,000/97=1443 +29/97≈1443.2989.

So original money is approximately 1443.30 cents. 3% is 43.30, so spent 1400.

Gum cost 5*30=150. So 1400-150=1250. 1250/50=25. So 25 pretzels. That makes sense.

So the answer is 25.


1. **Determine total money spent:** Andre spent ₺1400 and had 3% left as change. Let his original amount be \( X \). The remaining 3% is \( 0.03X \), so the amount spent is \( X - 0.03X = 0.97X = 1400 \). Solving for \( X \):
   \[
   X = \frac{1400}{0.97} \approx 1443.30 \text{ cents (assuming amounts are in cents)}.
   \]
   Thus, he spent \( 1400 \) cents.

2. **Calculate cost of gum:** He bought 5 bags of gum at 30 cents each:
   \[
   5 \times 30 = 150 \text{ cents}.
   \]

3. **Determine remaining amount for pretzels:** Subtract the gum cost from the total spent:
   \[
   1400 - 150 = 1250 \text{ cents}.
   \]

4. **Compute number of pretzels:** Each pretzel costs 50 cents. Dividing the remaining amount by the pretzel price:
   \[
   \frac{1250}{50} = 25.
   \]

15,"Xavier is selling cupcake and apricot pie for a fundraiser. On Sunday, he sold 27 boxes of cupcake and 14 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Monday. On Monday, he sold 12 more boxes of cupcakes than on Sunday and 25 boxes of apricot pie. If the cupcake cost ₺12 and the apricot pie cost ₺31, how much did Xavier earn for two days?","He sold 27 + 12 = 39 boxes of cupcake on Monday.
The total number of boxes of cupcakes that Xavier sold is 27 + 39 = 66.
Xavier earned 66 x ₺12 = ₺792 for selling cupcakes.
He sold 25 - 14 = 11 boxes of apricot pie on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of apricot pie that Xavier sold is 25 + 11 = 36.
He earned 36 x ₺31 = ₺1116 for selling apricot pie.
So, Xavier earned ₺792 + ₺1116 = ₺1908 for two days.
#### 1908","₺12 per cupcake box and ₺31 per apricot pie box. We need to find his total earnings for Sunday and Monday combined.

The problem mentions Sunday and Monday separately, so I should calculate each day's sales and then add them up. Let me start with Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 27 boxes of cupcakes. That's straightforward. Then, for apricot pies on Sunday, it says he sold 14 fewer boxes than on Monday. Wait, so the number of apricot pies on Sunday is Monday's apricot pies minus 14? But wait, Monday's apricot pie sales are given as 25 boxes. Oh, right! Because the problem states that on Monday, he sold 25 boxes of apricot pies. So Sunday's apricot pies would be 25 (Monday's) minus 14. Let me check that again. Yes: ""On Sunday, he sold 27 boxes of cupcakes and 14 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Monday."" So Sunday apricot = Monday apricot -14. Since Monday's apricot is 25, Sunday's would be 25 -14 = 11. So Sunday's apricot pies are 11 boxes.

Wait, let me confirm that again. The problem says: On Sunday, he sold 27 boxes of cupcake and 14 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Monday. So the structure is: Sunday's apricot = Monday's apricot -14. And Monday's apricot is 25. So yes, 25 -14 = 11. So Sunday's apricot pies are 11.

Now, moving to Monday. On Monday, he sold 12 more boxes of cupcakes than on Sunday. Since Sunday's cupcakes are 27, Monday's would be 27 +12 = 39 boxes. And as mentioned, apricot pies on Monday are 25 boxes. So that's clear.

So now, let me sum up the numbers for each day.

First, Sunday:
- Cupcakes: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies: 11 boxes

Monday:
- Cupcakes: 39 boxes
- Apricot pies: 25 boxes

Now, the total earnings per day. For each day, multiply the number of each item by their respective prices and sum them up.

Let's compute Sunday's earnings first.

Sunday's cupcake earnings: 27 * ₺12. Let me calculate that. 27 * 10 = 270, 27*2=54. So total 270 +54 = ₺324.

Sunday's apricot pie earnings: 11 * ₺31. Hmm, 10*31=310, 1*31=31. So 310 +31 = ₺341.

Wait, wait, 11*31 is 341. So total for Sunday is 324 +341. Let's add those: 300 + 300 is 600, 24 +41 is 65. So total 665. So Sunday's total is ₺665.

Now, Monday's earnings. 

Monday's cupcakes: 39 *12. Let's compute that. 40*12=480, minus 1*12=12. So 480-12=468.

Apricot pies on Monday: 25*31. 25*30=750, 25*1=25. So 750+25=775.

So Monday's total earnings: 468 +775. Let's add. 400+700=1100, 60+75=135. So 1100+135=1235. So Monday is ₺1235.

Now, total for two days is 665 +1235. Let's add. 600+1200=1800, 65+35=100. Wait, 665+1235: 665+1200=1865, then +35 is 1900. Wait, wait. Let me check again.

Wait 665 + 1235:

Breakdown:

665 + 1235 = (600 + 60 +5) + (1200 +30 +5)

Combine hundreds: 600+1200=1800

Tens: 60+30=90

Ones:5+5=10

So total: 1800 +90=1890 +10=1900. Yes, that's correct.

So Xavier earned a total of ₺1900 over the two days.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, check the numbers for each day.

Sunday: Cupcakes 27, Apricot 11. Correct because Monday's apricot is 25, so 25-14=11. Yes.

Monday: Cupcakes 27+12=39, correct. Apricot 25, given. Correct.

Calculations:

Sunday:

Cupcakes: 27*12=324.

Apricot:11*31=341. 324+341=665. Correct.

Monday:

Cupcakes:39*12. Let's compute 39*10=390, 39*2=78. 390+78=468. Correct.

Apricot:25*31=775. Correct.

Total Monday:468+775=1235. Correct.

Total two days:665+1235=1900. Correct.

So the answer is ₺1900.


1. **Determine Sunday's apricot pie sales:**  
   - Monday's apricot pies = 25 boxes (given).  
   - Sunday sold 14 fewer than Monday: 25 - 14 = 11 boxes.  

2. **Calculate Monday's cupcake sales:**  
   - Sunday's cupcakes = 27 boxes (given).  
   - Monday sold 12 more than Sunday: 27 + 12 = 39 boxes.  

3. **Compute earnings for Sunday:**  
   - Cupcakes: 27 × ₺12 = ₺324.  
   - Apricot pies: 11 × ₺31 = ₺341.  
   - Total for Sunday: ₺324 + ₺341 = ₺665.  

4. **Compute earnings for Monday:**  
   - Cupcakes: 39 × ₺12 = ₺468.  
   - Apricot pies: 25 × ₺31 = ₺775.  
   - Total for Monday: ₺468 + ₺775 = ₺1,235.  

5. **Sum earnings for both days:**  
   - Total earnings: ₺665 + ₺1,235 = ₺1,900.

19,Wei hires a boat from 2 PM to 7 PM. He gets 1 hours free. The first paid hour is ₺11 and each hour after that is thrice the cost. How much did he pay?,"He got it for 7-2=5 hours
He pays for 5-1=4 hours
The first hour cost 1*11=₺11
The other 4-1=3 hours are more expensive
They cost 11*3=₺33 per hour
So those 3 hours cost 3*33=₺99
So he pays 99+11=₺110
#### 110","₺11, and each subsequent hour is thrice the cost of the previous one. Hmm, thrice means three times. So each hour after the first one is three times the previous hour's cost. Wait, does that mean each hour after the first is three times the cost of the first hour, or three times the previous hour's cost? The wording says ""each hour after that is thrice the cost"". Maybe it's each subsequent hour costs three times the previous hour's rate. Let me think. For example, first paid hour is ₺11, the second would be 3 * 11 = ₺33, third would be 3 * 33 = ₺99, and so on. So each hour's cost triples from the previous one.

So, he has 4 paid hours. Let's break them down:

First hour: ₺11.

Second hour: 11 * 3 = ₺33.

Third hour: 33 * 3 = ₺99.

Fourth hour: 99 * 3 = ₺297.

Now, add all those up. 11 + 33 is 44. Then 44 + 99 is 143. Then 143 + 297 is 440. So total cost would be ₺440.

Wait, wait a second. Let me verify the math again. 11 + 33 = 44. 44 + 99 = 143. 143 + 297. Let's do that addition carefully. 143 + 200 is 343, then +97 is 440. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem says each hour after the first paid hour is thrice the cost. Wait, the original question says: ""the first paid hour is ₺11 and each hour after that is thrice the cost."" Hmm. So the first paid hour is 11, then each subsequent paid hour is thrice the cost. But thrice which cost? Thrice the initial 11? Or thrice the previous hour's cost?

The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: ""the first paid hour is ₺11 and each hour after that is thrice the cost."" So ""thrice the cost"" could mean thrice the cost of the first hour. So perhaps each hour after the first is 3*11 = 33. So if there are four paid hours, the first is 11, then the next three are 33 each. Then total would be 11 + 3*33 = 11 + 99 = 110. But that's different. Wait, but the problem says ""each hour after that is thrice the cost"". If ""that"" refers to the first hour, then each subsequent hour is 3 times 11. But if ""each hour after that"" refers to each previous hour, then each next hour is tripled. Which interpretation is correct?

This is a critical point. Let's look at the original question again: ""the first paid hour is ₺11 and each hour after that is thrice the cost."" The phrase ""after that"" might mean each subsequent hour's cost is thrice the prior one. For example, first hour 11, second 33, third 99, etc. That's the usual way such problems are structured. If each hour after the first is three times the previous, it's a geometric progression. So for 4 hours:

1st hour: 11

2nd: 11*3 = 33

3rd: 33*3 =99

4th: 99*3=297

Total: 11+33+99+297= 440. So that's the calculation. But maybe the problem meant that each hour after the first is three times the initial cost. In that case, each hour after the first is 33, so 11 + 33*3= 11+99=110. But that's a different total. Which is correct?

The wording is a bit ambiguous. The problem states ""each hour after that is thrice the cost"". So ""thrice the cost"" of what? If ""that"" refers to the first hour, then thrice the cost of the first hour. But if it's ""each hour after that"", then ""thrice the cost"" would likely refer to the previous hour's cost. For example, like a compounding effect. So each subsequent hour is tripled from the previous. That makes the cost escalate quickly, which might be intended here.

So, given that, the correct approach is to triple each hour after the first. So for 4 hours:

1st: 11

2nd: 11 *3 =33

3rd:33 *3=99

4th:99*3=297

Summing these gives 440.

Thus, the answer should be 440.

20,"Leilani has a flower bed that is 189 meters long. Leilani wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Leilani's flowers grow 4 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant. Leilani already owns 13 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₺14 at the store, how much money will Leilani spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Leilani's flower bed is 189 meters / 13.5 meters per plant = 14 plants needed.
Leilani needs to buy 14 plants - 13 plants = 1 plants needed to purchase.
Leilani will spend 1 plants * ₺14 = ₺14.
#### 14","₺14, and we need to find out how much she'll spend to fill the bed.

Hmm. First, I need to figure out how many total plants can fit in the 189-meter length, considering both the space the plants take and the gaps between them. Then subtract the 13 she already has to find out how many more she needs to buy. Multiply that by 14 to get the total cost.

Wait, how do the spacing work? Each plant is 4 meters wide, and between each plant, there's 13.5 meters. So maybe the spacing is after each plant except the last one? Like, if there are N plants, then the total length would be (4*N) + (13.5*(N-1)) meters. Because between each pair of plants, there's a gap. So for example, 2 plants would be 4 + 13.5 +4 = 21.5 meters. So the formula is 4*N +13.5*(N-1) ≤ 189.

So let me write that equation: 4N +13.5(N-1) ≤189. Let's compute that. Combine terms: 4N +13.5N -13.5 ≤189. So 17.5N -13.5 ≤189. Add 13.5 to both sides: 17.5N ≤ 202.5. Then divide by 17.5: N ≤202.5/17.5. Let me calculate that. 202.5 divided by 17.5. 17.5*11=192.5, 202.5-192.5=10. So 11 + 10/17.5. 10/17.5 is about 0.571. So around 11.571. Since she can't have a fraction of a plant, she can have 11 plants? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait 17.5N = 202.5 → N = 202.5 /17.5. Let's compute this as a decimal. 202.5 ÷17.5. Let's see: 17.5 × 11 = 192.5. Subtract that from 202.5: 10. So 10 ÷17.5 = 0.571. So total N=11.571. But since you can't have a fraction of a plant, she can only fit 11 plants. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check if 11 plants fit exactly.

Let me plug back N=11 into the total length. 4*11 =44. 13.5*(11-1)=13.5*10=135. Total 44+135=179 meters. Which is less than 189. So then what if N=12? Let's check. 4*12=48, 13.5*11=148.5. Total 48+148.5=196.5, which is more than 189. So 12 plants would require 196.5 meters, which is too long. Therefore, the maximum number of plants is 11. But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me verify the math again.

Wait, the original equation: 4N +13.5(N-1) ≤189. So for N=11: 4*11=44, 13.5*10=135. 44+135=179, which is 10 meters less than 189. That's a lot of leftover space. Maybe there's a miscalculation here. Wait, maybe the spacing is not between each plant but in another way? Like if she starts with a plant, then space, then plant, etc. So the total length would be plant + gap + plant + gap... etc. So the number of gaps is one less than the number of plants. So perhaps Leilani can use the remaining space after 11 plants and 10 gaps. But 179 is way less than 189. Maybe the problem is that the formula is correct but perhaps she can fit more plants by adding another one at the end without the gap. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps she can adjust the arrangement. Let me think again. Suppose she arranges the plants with the required spacing between them. So each plant takes 4m, then a gap of 13.5m. So for each additional plant after the first, it's 4m plus 13.5m. So the first plant is 4m, then each subsequent plant adds 13.5+4 =17.5m. So total length for N plants is 4 + (N-1)*17.5.

Ah, that's another way to see it. So the total length would be 4 +17.5*(N-1). Let's set that ≤189. Then:

4 +17.5*(N-1) ≤189

17.5*(N-1) ≤185

N-1 ≤185 /17.5

185 ÷17.5. Let's compute 17.5*10=175, so 185-175=10. 10/17.5=0.571. So N-1 ≤10.571 → N-1=10 → N=11. So same result. So 11 plants. But wait, if N=11, then total length is 4 +17.5*10=4 +175=179, which is again 179. So even if she adds another plant, N=12, 4 +17.5*11=4+192.5=196.5>189. So still, 11 is maximum.

Hmm, but 179 meters is only part of the 189. That's 10 meters left. But according to the problem statement, the spacing has to be 13.5 meters between every plant. So she can't put another plant because the next spacing is 13.5m, which would need to be after the 11th plant. Wait, but maybe she can put an extra plant at the end without the spacing?

Wait, the problem says she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant. So between each pair of plants, there must be 13.5 meters. So if you have 12 plants, you need 11 gaps of 13.5. So the total would be 12*4 +11*13.5. Let's compute that: 48 + 148.5=196.5. Which exceeds 189. So no. But if she tries 11 plants, that's 44 + 135=179. So the remaining 10 meters. But the problem says she has to leave 13.5m between every plant. So she can't place another plant because even if she has 10m left, she can't fit a 13.5m gap. Wait, but perhaps she can use the remaining space for a smaller gap? But the problem states that she ""needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant."" So the gaps must be 13.5m. So she can't use smaller gaps. Therefore, she can only fit 11 plants.

Wait, but that leaves her 189-179=10 meters unused. But maybe the flower bed is 189 meters long, and she can adjust the arrangement. For example, perhaps the spacing can be placed after the last plant? No, because spacing is between plants. So if there's N plants, there are N-1 gaps. So the total is plants plus gaps. So the 10 meters left is just extra space that can't be used, given the spacing requirements. So she can only fit 11 plants.

But the problem says she already owns 13 flowers. Wait, that's more than 11. Then how? If she can only fit 11 plants, but she already has 13, that would mean she has more plants than fit. But the problem says she wants to fill the flower bed. So maybe the calculation is wrong. Because if she can't even plant all 13 she already has, then she doesn't need to buy any. But that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I miscalculated the total length needed. Let's re-express the total length.

Each plant is 4m wide, and each gap between plants is 13.5m. So for N plants, the number of gaps is N-1. So total length is 4*N +13.5*(N-1).

We set this equal to 189 to find maximum N possible.

So:

4N +13.5(N-1) ≤189

4N +13.5N -13.5 ≤189

17.5N -13.5 ≤189

17.5N ≤189 +13.5=202.5

N ≤202.5 /17.5= 11.571.

So N=11.571. Since you can't have 0.571 of a plant, you take the integer part, so N=11. So 11 plants.

But the problem says she already has 13 flowers. So she has more than the maximum that can fit. So she can't plant all 13. Therefore, she would only plant 11, and thus she doesn't need to buy any more. But the problem states she wants to ""fill up her flower bed"". So maybe there's an error here.

Wait, maybe I inverted the spacing. Maybe the spacing is 13.5 between each plant, but that's the total required between them, not the width. Wait, no, the problem says ""needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant"". So between each plant, there's a 13.5m gap. So if she has two plants, the total length is 4 +13.5 +4=21.5. Which is 2*4 +1*13.5=8 +13.5=21.5. Correct.

So the calculation seems right. So the maximum number of plants is 11. She already has 13. So she already has more than needed. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any plants. But the answer would be zero. But that seems odd. Maybe the problem is intended to have a different setup.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem. The flowers grow 4 meters wide. So each plant's width is 4 meters. And between each plant, there's 13.5 meters of space. So the total for N plants is 4*N +13.5*(N-1). Which for N=11 is 44 +135=179.

But 189 is the total length. So 179 is less than 189. But can she add another plant? Let's see: N=12 would be 4*12 +13.5*11=48 +148.5=196.5>189. So that's over. So no. But wait, maybe the problem allows her to use the remaining space in some other way. But according to the problem, she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant, so all gaps must be 13.5. Therefore, you can't have a smaller gap. So she can't use the remaining 10 meters. So she can only plant 11.

But she already has 13. So she has more than enough. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. So the answer would be zero. But the problem says ""fill her flower bed with plants"", so maybe she can't use all 13 because there's not enough space. Therefore, she only plants 11. So she already has enough, no need to buy. But the problem asks how much she needs to spend to fill up the bed. So if she has 13 flowers, but can only plant 11, then she doesn't need to buy any. So answer is zero.

But this seems counterintuitive. Perhaps the problem expects that the spacing is 13.5 meters between the centers of the plants? But that would be different. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the spacing. Let me read again: ""Leilani's flowers grow 4 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant."" So each flower is 4m wide, and between the plants, there's 13.5m of space. So the spacing is from the end of one plant to the start of the next. So if a plant is 4m wide, the distance from the start of one to the start of the next would be 4 +13.5=17.5m. Therefore, for N plants, the total length required would be (N-1)*17.5 +4. Which is the same as before. So yes, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, she can only fit 11 plants. Since she has 13, she already has more than enough. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. So the cost is 0.

But the problem states that she wants to fill her flower bed. If the flower bed is 189 meters, but she can only use 179 meters with 11 plants, maybe the problem expects her to use the entire length by adjusting the spacing? But the problem says she ""needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant"", so that spacing is fixed. Therefore, no adjustment possible. Therefore, the answer is 0.

But perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the unit conversion or the way the spacing is calculated. Wait, perhaps the 4 meters is the total width per plant, and the spacing is between the centers. But the problem says ""4 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant."" So probably the 13.5 meters is the space between the plants, not including their own width. So the calculation as done before is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows the last plant to not need the spacing. For example, if she arranges the plants as: plant, space, plant, space, ..., plant. So the number of spaces is one less than the number of plants. So for example, if she has 12 plants, 11 spaces. Which would be 12*4 +11*13.5. Which is 48 +148.5=196.5>189. Still too much.

But if she has 11 plants, 10 spaces: 44 +135=179. So 10 meters left. The problem states she needs to leave 13.5m between every plant. So even if there's space after the last plant, that's allowed. The requirement is just between the plants. So perhaps the unused space is acceptable, as long as the required spacing between plants is maintained. So the answer is 11 plants, which she can accommodate with her existing 13. So she doesn't need to buy any. So cost is zero.

But maybe the question is different. Maybe the 13.5 meters is between the centers of the plants. Let's think differently. If each plant is 4m wide, then the radius is 2m. So the distance between centers would need to be 2 +13.5 +2=17.5m. But that would give the same calculation as before. So total length per plant plus spacing. So same result.

Alternatively, maybe the spacing is measured edge to edge, so between the edges of the plants. So the space between two plants is 13.5 meters. Therefore, the total distance between centers would be 4 +13.5=17.5 meters. Which again, same calculation.

So it all points to N=11. But if she has 13 flowers, she already has enough. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any, so cost is zero. But that feels counter to the problem's setup. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully:

""Leilani has a flower bed that is 189 meters long. Leilani wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Leilani's flowers grow 4 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant. Leilani already owns 13 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₺14 at the store, how much money will Leilani spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?""

Wait, maybe the problem is not about planting all the flowers she has, but filling the flower bed completely. So even if she has more flowers than needed, she needs to fill the flower bed. Wait, but if the flower bed can only take 11 plants, and she already has 13, she can't plant all of them. So she would only plant 11, but since she already has 13, she doesn't need to buy any. Therefore, answer is 0.

But that seems odd. The problem says she wants to ""fill her flower bed with plants."" So maybe the correct answer is that she needs to buy additional plants to cover the entire 189 meters. But according to the calculations, that's not possible with the spacing constraints. Therefore, the maximum number is 11. So she can't fill the entire 189 meters. But the question might assume that she can adjust spacing to fit more. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the problem considers that the total space taken by the plants and gaps is equal to the bed length, but perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the 13.5 meters is the required space between plants, but not including their width. Wait, the way the problem is phrased: ""flowers grow 4 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant."" So perhaps the total width per plant plus spacing is 4 +13.5=17.5 meters per plant, but the next plant's 4 meters would start after the 13.5 spacing. Wait, but that's same as before.

Alternatively, maybe it's 4 meters per plant and 13.5 meters between them, so the distance from center to center is 4/2 +13.5 +4/2= 2 +13.5 +2=17.5 meters. So same as before.

Therefore, the calculation remains the same: 11 plants.

So she needs 11, has 13. So she already has enough. So answer is 0.

But the problem is asking for how much she will spend. Maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check if the maximum number of plants is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me redo the equation.

Total length = number of plants * width + number of gaps * spacing.

Number of gaps = number of plants -1.

So 4*N +13.5*(N-1) ≤189.

Let's compute for N=11: 4*11=44, 13.5*10=135. 44+135=179 <189.

N=12: 4*12=48, 13.5*11=148.5. 48+148.5=196.5>189.

So N=11 is maximum. So Leilani needs 11 plants. She has 13. So she can plant 11, and has 2 extra. Therefore, she does not need to buy any. So cost is zero.

Therefore, the answer is 0.


1. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the 189-meter bed**:
   - Each plant requires 4 meters of width, and 13.5 meters of spacing is needed between adjacent plants.
   - For \( N \) plants, the total length used is \( 4N + 13.5(N-1) \).
   - Set up the equation: \( 4N + 13.5(N-1) \leq 189 \).
   - Simplify: \( 17.5N - 13.5 \leq 189 \) → \( 17.5N \leq 202.5 \) → \( N \leq 11.571 \).
   - Since \( N \) must be an integer, the maximum number of plants is **11**.

2. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed**:
   - Leilani already owns **13** plants, but only **11** can fit in the flower bed.
   - She already has more plants than needed, so no additional purchases are required.

3. **Compute the total cost**:
   - Additional plants needed: \( 11 - 13 = -2 \) (no need to buy more).
   - Total cost: \( 0 \times 14 = 0 \) ₺.

He pays for 6-2=4 hours
The first hour cost 1*12=₺12

So those 3 hours cost 3*24=₺72
So he pays 72+12=₺84
#### 84","₺12, and each hour after that is twice the cost. Wait, that might mean the first hour he pays for is ₺12, then the second paid hour is ₺24, third is ₺48, and so on, doubling each time.

Wait, but does that apply to each subsequent hour after the first paid hour? Let me make sure. The problem says: ""The first paid hour is ₺12 and each hour after that is twice the cost."" So the first hour he pays for is 12, then each subsequent hour is double the previous. So like, first hour: 12, second: 24, third: 48, fourth: 96. So each hour's cost doubles the previous one.

But he has 4 paid hours. Let me check again. Total rental is 6 hours. Free 2 hours, so paid hours are 4. Wait, but maybe the two hours free are subtracted from the total. So 6 hours minus 2 free hours leaves 4 paid hours. So he needs to pay for 4 hours. 

But the payment structure is: first paid hour is 12, then each next hour is double. So first paid hour: 12. Second paid hour: 12*2=24. Third paid hour: 24*2=48. Fourth paid hour:48*2=96. Then adding all those up: 12 +24+48+96. Let's calculate that. 

12+24 is 36. 36+48 is 84. 84+96 is 180. So total cost would be 180 lira. Is that right? Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the first paid hour is 12, then each hour after that (the first paid hour) is twice the cost. So the first paid hour is 12, and each subsequent paid hour is double the previous. So if there are 4 paid hours, then:

1st paid hour: 12

2nd: 12*2=24

3rd: 24*2=48

4th:48*2=96

Sum:12+24=36; 36+48=84; 84+96=180. Yes, that's 180. So the total payment would be 180 lira. That seems correct. So the answer should be 180. Let me make sure there's no other interpretation.

Wait, another way: maybe the first hour of the entire rental is free, then the next two hours are free? Wait, the problem says ""He gets 2 hours free."" So total 2 hours free. So whether those two hours are consecutive or could be spread out? But the problem doesn't specify, so the most straightforward is that the first two hours are free. So from 4 PM to 6 PM free, then from 6 PM to 10 PM paid.

Wait, 4 PM to 10 PM is 6 hours. If he gets 2 hours free, then the remaining 4 hours are paid. So he's paying for 4 hours. 

But then the payment structure is: first paid hour (which would be the third hour overall) is 12, then each hour after that is double. So:

Hour 1: Free

Hour 2: Free

Hour 3: 12 TL

Hour 4: 12*2 =24 TL

Hour5:24*2=48 TL

Hour6:48*2=96 TL

Wait, but that would be each subsequent hour after the first paid hour. So if he has 4 paid hours, then the first of those is 12, each next is double the previous. So 12, 24,48,96. Total 180. 

Alternatively, maybe the first paid hour is 12, and each hour after the first is doubled. So second hour is 24, third is 48, etc. So yes, that's the same. 

So the answer is 180.

Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 120 shrimp / 20 shrimp/batch = 6 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 7 minutes/batch = 42 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Chen spends: 42 minutes + 20 minutes = 62 minutes
#### 62","1. **Peeling Rate**: Chen peels 6 shrimps per minute. To peel 120 shrimps, the time required is \( \frac{120}{6} = 20 \) minutes.

2. **Sautéing Rate**: Chen can sauté 20 shrimps in 7 minutes. For 120 shrimps, the number of batches needed is \( \frac{120}{20} = 6 \) batches. Total sautéing time is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) minutes.

3. **Overlap Analysis**: While sautéing, Chen can continue peeling. The first batch of 20 shrimps is peeled in \( \frac{20}{6} \approx 3.333 \) minutes. Sautéing this batch starts at \( t = 3.333 \) and finishes at \( t = 10.333 \). During this 7-minute sauté, she peels \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) more shrimps.

4. **Subsequent Batches**: After the first batch, each subsequent batch starts immediately after the previous sauté finishes. The total time for all 6 sauté batches is \( 3.333 + (6 \times 7) = 45.333 \) minutes. By \( t = 20 \), all 120 shrimps are peeled, and sautéing continues until \( t = 45.333 \).

5. **Final Time**: The total time is determined by the sautéing completion time since peeling finishes earlier. The exact time is \( \frac{136}{3} \) minutes (or \( 45 \frac{1}{3} \) minutes).

This means 88 people - 11 people = 77 people stayed.
Out of the 77 who stayed, 77 people - 23 artists = 54 were doctors.
#### 54","Step 1: Calculate the initial total number of people at the party.  
60 artists + 28 doctors = 88 people.  

Step 2: Determine how many people left after 45 minutes.  
One-eighth of 88 people left: \( \frac{88}{8} = 11 \) people.  

Step 3: Calculate the remaining people after 11 left.  
Total remaining = 88 - 11 = 77 people.  

Step 4: Use the given number of artists who stayed (23) to find remaining doctors.  
Artists remaining = 23.  
Doctors remaining = Total remaining - Artists remaining = 77 - 23 = 54.  

Step 5: Check consistency with the original number of doctors (28).  
54 doctors remaining exceeds the original 28 doctors, which is impossible. This indicates a contradiction in the problem's parameters.

27,"Mia has a flower bed that is 195 meters long. Mia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Mia's flowers grow 4 meters wide so she needs to leave 15.0 meters between every plant. Mia already owns 12 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €14 at the store, how much money will Mia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Mia's flower bed is 195 meters / 15.0 meters per plant = 13 plants needed.
Mia needs to buy 13 plants - 12 plants = 1 plants needed to purchase.
Mia will spend 1 plants * €14 = €14.
#### 14","1. Calculate the total space required per plant including spacing: Each plant is 4 meters wide, and 15 meters of spacing is needed between adjacent plants. Therefore, each additional plant after the first requires 4 + 15 = 19 meters of total space.

2. Determine the maximum number of plants that fit in the 195-meter bed:
   - The first plant takes 4 meters.
   - Subsequent plants take 19 meters each.
   - Total length formula: \(4 + 19 \times (N - 1) \leq 195\).
   - Solving for \(N\):
     \[
     19 \times (N - 1) \leq 191 \implies N - 1 \leq \frac{191}{19} \approx 10.05
     \]
     Thus, \(N = 11\) plants can fit (total length = \(4 + 19 \times 10 = 194\) meters).

3. Compare with existing plants: Mia already has 12 plants, which exceeds the 11 needed to fill the bed. She does not need to purchase additional plants.

Emma needs to buy 16 plants - 13 plants = 3 plants needed to purchase.
Emma will spend 3 plants * €13 = €39.
#### 39","1. **Determine the number of plants that fit in the flower bed:**
   - Each plant requires 7 feet of width, and 12.75 feet of spacing between plants.
   - Total length per plant including spacing (except the last plant): \(7 + 12.75 = 19.75\) feet.
   - Formula for total length: \(7n + 12.75(n - 1) \leq 204\), where \(n\) is the number of plants.
   - Simplify: \(19.75n - 12.75 \leq 204\) → \(19.75n \leq 216.75\) → \(n \leq 216.75 / 19.75 \approx 10.975\).
   - Since \(n\) must be an integer, **maximum \(n = 10\) plants**.

2. **Calculate remaining plants to purchase:**

Each plant occupies 4 feet in width, and 14 feet must be left between adjacent plants. For \( n \) plants, the total length used is \( 4n + 14(n-1) \).  

Step 2: Solve for \( n \) to find the maximum number of plants that fit in the 154-foot bed.  
\[

Theo spent 1207.5 on gum because 1209.0 - 1.5 = 1207.5
Theo bought 1610 gum because 1207.5 / 0.75 = 1610
#### 1610","To solve the problem, let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Determine Theo's Initial Money (M):**
   - Theo spent ₣1300 and had 7% of his money left as change.
   - Let \( M \) be the original amount of money Theo had. The total spent is \( 93\% \) of \( M \) (since \( 100\% - 7\% = 93\% \)):  
     \[
     0.93M = 1300 \implies M = \frac{1300}{0.93} \approx 1397.85 \, \text{Florins}.
     \]

2. **Calculate Total Cost of Items Bought:**
   - The 1300 Florins spent must equal the combined cost of pretzels and gum:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of pretzels} + \text{Cost of gum}.
     \]

3. **Compute Cost of Pretzels:**
   - Each pretzel costs 25 cents (₣0.25), and he bought 6 bags:  
     \[
     \text{Cost of pretzels} = 6 \times 0.25 = 1.5 \, \text{Florins}.
     \]

4. **Set Up Equation for Cost of Gum:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gums bought. Each gum costs 75 cents (₣0.75):
     \[
     0.75G + 1.5 = 1300.
     \]

5. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Subtract the pretzel cost from the total spent:  
     \[
     0.75G = 1300 - 1.5 \implies 0.75G = 1298.5.
     \]
   - Divide to find \( G \):  
     \[
     G = \frac{1298.5}{0.75} \approx 1731.33.
     \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The result \( G \approx 1731.33 \) indicates a fractional number of gums purchased, which is impossible. This discrepancy suggests a potential error in the problem's unit conventions or numerical setup. However, **rounding to the nearest whole number**, the closest valid answer is \( G = 1731 \).

Given the problem constraints, the answer is likely intended to be an integer. Despite unit inconsistencies, **the most plausible integer solution** for \( G \) is derived above.

44,"Yusuf caught 6 trouts last Wednesday, the first trout he caught weighs 60 kgs, the second trout he caught weighs 39 kgs, and the last trout he caught weighs 38 kgs. If a kg of trout costs €1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Yusuf will earn 60 x €1.0 = €60.0 from the first trout.
He will earn 39 x €1.0 = €39.0 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 6-2 = 4. He will earn 38 x €1.0 = €38.0 per each of them. So he will earn 4 * 38.0 = =152.0
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is €60.0 + €39.0 + €152.0= €251.
#### 251","Step 1: Identify the given weights of the trouts. Yusuf caught 6 trout, with the first 60 kg, the second 39 kg, and the sixth (last) 38 kg.  
Step 2: Notice missing data for trout 3, 4, and 5. The problem does not provide their weights, making the total weight calculation incomplete.  
Step 3: Assume a potential typo in the problem. If ""last trout"" refers to the third trout (instead of trout 6) and the total number of trout is 3 (rather than 6), adjust the interpretation.  
Step 4: Sum the weights of trout 1 (60 kg), trout 2 (39 kg), and trout 3 (38 kg) under this assumption: 60 + 39 + 38 = 137 kg.  
Step 5: Calculate earnings: 137 kg × €1.0/kg = €137.

45,"At Tariq's house, there are five times as many corns as pears. He has a total of 48 pears in his house. Tariq bought 55 more pears at the store and 34 fewer corns than the number of pears. Find the combined total of the number of corns and pears Tariq has in the house?","Before buying any corn and pear, Tariq had 5 times as many corns as pears, which is 48 pears * 5 corn/pear = 240 corns
The total number of corns and pears that Tariq had before is 240 corns + 48 pears = 288 items
When he bought 34 fewer corns than pears, he bought 55 corns - 34 corns = 21 corns
In total, he bought 21 corns + 55 pears = 76 items
After the purchases, Tariq has 288 items + 76 items = 364 total corns and pears combined.
#### 364","1. **Original Pears:** Tariq initially has 48 pears.  
2. **Original Corns:** Since there are five times as many corns as pears, multiply the original pears by 5:  
   \( 48 \times 5 = 240 \) corns.  
3. **New Pears After Purchase:** After buying 55 more pears, the total pears become:  
   \( 48 + 55 = 103 \).  
4. **Corn Purchased:** The corn bought is 34 fewer than the updated number of pears (103), so subtract 34:  
   \( 103 - 34 = 69 \) corns.  
5. **Total Corn Afterwards:** Add the purchased corns to the original corns:  
   \( 240 + 69 = 309 \).  
6. **Combined Total:** Sum the final counts of pears and corns:  
   \( 103 \, (\text{pears}) + 309 \, (\text{corns}) = 412 \).

46,Kimia can peel 8 onions a minute and saute 40 onions in 13 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 160 onions?,"First find how long it takes Kimia to peel the onion: 160 onion / 8 onion/minute = 20 minutes
Then find how many batches of onion she needs to cook: 160 onion / 40 onion/batch = 4 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 4 batches * 13 minutes/batch = 52 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Kimia spends: 52 minutes + 20 minutes = 72 minutes
#### 72","Step 1: Determine peeling rate. Kimia peels 8 onions per minute.  
Step 2: Determine sautéing rate. Sautéing 40 onions takes 13 minutes, so the rate is \( \frac{40}{13} \approx 3.077 \) onions per minute.  
Step 3: Calculate sequential time if tasks are done separately.  
- Peeling 160 onions: \( \frac{160}{8} = 20 \) minutes.  
- Sautéing 160 onions: \( \frac{160}{40} \times 13 = 52 \) minutes.  
- Sequential total: \( 20 + 52 = 72 \) minutes.  

Step 4: Account for overlapping tasks. Kimia can start sautéing as soon as the first batch is peeled.  
- First batch: Peel 40 onions (5 minutes), then sauté (13 minutes). During sautéing (5–18 minutes), she peels \( 8 \times 13 = 104 \) onions. Total peeled by 18 minutes: \( 40 + 104 = 144 \).  
- Second batch: Sauté next 40 onions (18–31 minutes). During this time, peel \( 8 \times 13 = 104 \) onions, but only 16 more are needed (160 total). Peeling 16 onions takes 2 minutes (ends at 20 minutes).  
- Remaining sautéing: After 20 minutes, 120 onions remain. Three batches of 40 onions take \( 3 \times 13 = 39 \) minutes.  

Step 5: Combine overlapping times.  
- Final sauté batch ends at \( 20 + 39 = 59 \) minutes. However, correcting for earlier overlaps:  
- Batches 1–4 end at 18, 31, 44, and 57 minutes. Total time is 57 minutes.

47,"Elena has a flower bed that is 182 meters long. Elena wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Elena's flowers grow 5 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.0 meters between every plant. Elena already owns 10 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €4 at the store, how much money will Elena spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Elena's flower bed is 182 meters / 13.0 meters per plant = 14 plants needed.
Elena needs to buy 14 plants - 10 plants = 4 plants needed to purchase.
Elena will spend 4 plants * €4 = €16.
#### 16","1. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the 182-meter bed:**
   - Each plant requires 5 meters of width, and there must be 13 meters between adjacent plants.
   - For **n** plants, the total length occupied is:  
     \(5n + 13(n - 1) \leq 182\).  
     Simplifying: \(18n - 13 \leq 182\) → \(18n \leq 195\) → \(n \leq 10.833\).  
     Since **n** must be an integer, the maximum number of plants is **10**.

2. **Check if additional plants can fit in the remaining space:**
   - With 10 plants, the total length used is:  
     \(5(10) + 13(9) = 50 + 117 = 167 \text{ meters}\).  
     Remaining space: \(182 - 167 = 15 \text{ meters}\).  
     Adding an 11th plant would require 13 meters of spacing after the 10th plant, followed by 5 meters for the plant itself (\(13 + 5 = 18 \text{ meters}\)), which exceeds the remaining 15 meters. Thus, no additional plants can fit.

3. **Calculate the number of plants Elena needs to buy:**
   - Elena already owns 10 flowers, which matches the maximum capacity of the bed.  
     Additional plants needed: \(10 - 10 = 0\).

4. **Compute the total cost:**
   - Each plant costs €4, so total cost: \(0 \times 4 = €0\).

Keisha will spend 6 plants * $11 = $66.
#### 66","1. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the 192-foot flower bed.**  
   Each plant occupies 7 feet, and 12 feet of spacing is required between adjacent plants. For \( n \) plants, the total length used is:  
   \[
   7n + 12(n - 1) = 19n - 12

   Set this equal to 192 feet:  
   \[
   19n - 12 = 192 \implies 19n = 204 \implies n \approx 10.74

   Since fractional plants are not possible, the maximum integer value is \( n = 10 \).  

2. **Verify total length for 10 plants:**

He pays for 9-2=7 hours
The first hour cost 1*40=₣40
The other 7-1=6 hours are more expensive
They cost 40*2=₣80 per hour
So those 6 hours cost 6*80=₣480
So he pays 480+40=₣520
#### 520","₣40, and each hour after that is twice the cost. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the paid hours start after the free ones. So first, subtract the 2 free hours. So total paid hours are 7. Now, the first hour of these paid hours is ₣40. Then each subsequent hour is double the previous one. Wait, the problem says ""each hour after that is twice the cost."" Let me read that again. The first paid hour is ₣40, each hour after that is twice the cost. So the first hour is 40, the second hour is 80 (double), third is 160, etc. But does it mean each subsequent hour's cost is twice the previous hour's cost, or twice the initial cost? The wording says ""each hour after that is twice the cost."" Probably, each hour after the first is double the previous. So like, it's a doubling each hour.

So, for 7 paid hours:

1st hour: 40
2nd hour: 40 * 2 = 80
3rd hour: 80 * 2 = 160
4th hour: 160 * 2 = 320
5th hour: 320 * 2 = 640
6th hour: 640 * 2 = 1280
7th hour: 1280 * 2 = 2560

Wait, that seems like the cost is doubling each hour, which would get really expensive. Let me check if that's correct. If the first hour is 40, and each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous one. So each hour is 2x the previous. So the total would be a geometric series: 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560. Then adding all of these up.

But adding these numbers: 40 + 80 = 120; +160=280; +320=600; +640=1240; +1280=2520; +2560=5080. So total payment would be 5080 francs? That seems very high, but maybe that's the case.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-examine the question. It says: ""The first paid hour is ₣40 and each hour after that is twice the cost."" So perhaps, after the first paid hour, each additional hour is twice the initial cost. But that would mean, first hour 40, then each hour after that is 80. Wait, but that's not how the sentence reads. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's parse it again.

Original statement: ""The first paid hour is ₣40 and each hour after that is twice the cost."" The phrase ""twice the cost"" could refer to twice the cost of the first hour. So, first hour 40, each subsequent hour is 80. That would be each hour after the first is 2*40=80. Then, total would be 40 + (6 hours * 80) = 40 + 480 = 520. But that's different from the previous interpretation.

Hmm, which is correct? The problem says ""each hour after that is twice the cost"". The ""cost"" here could refer to the cost of the previous hour. So each hour after the first is twice the previous hour's cost. So it's exponential. Alternatively, maybe ""twice the cost"" refers to twice the initial cost. But the way it's written, ""each hour after that is twice the cost"", without specifying of what. So in common language, if someone says ""each subsequent hour costs twice as much"", it's typically interpreted as each hour after the previous. So first hour 40, then 80, 160, etc. So that's the exponential case.

But let's consider the total paid hours. He has 7 paid hours. So using the first approach where each hour after the first is double the previous, the total would be 40 + 80 + 160 + 320 + 640 + 1280 + 2560. Let's compute this step by step.

First, list all seven terms:

1. 40

2. 40 * 2 = 80

3. 80 * 2 = 160

4. 160 * 2 = 320

5. 320 * 2 = 640

6. 640 * 2 = 1280

7. 1280 * 2 = 2560

Adding these up:

Start with 40 (total so far: 40)

Add 80 → 120

Add 160 → 280

Add 320 → 600

Add 640 → 1240

Add 1280 → 2520

Add 2560 → 5080

So total is 5080 francs. That's a huge amount, but if the problem states it that way, then that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem means that each hour after the first is 40*2=80, and stays at 80. But the wording is ""each hour after that is twice the cost"". If ""that"" refers to the previous hour, then each subsequent hour is double the prior.

Alternatively, maybe ""each hour after the first"" is priced at twice the initial rate. For example, first hour 40, then each additional hour is 40*2=80. So in that case, the total would be 40 + (6 * 80) = 40 + 480 = 520.

But which interpretation is correct? The wording is ambiguous. Let's look again: ""The first paid hour is ₣40 and each hour after that is twice the cost."" The phrase ""after that"" refers to the first paid hour. So each hour after the first paid hour is twice the cost of the first paid hour. Or twice the cost of the previous hour?

In financial contexts, if it's a compounding increase, it would usually be stated as ""each subsequent hour doubles the previous hour's cost"". If it's a fixed rate, it's ""each hour after the first is charged at twice the initial rate"". The problem here says ""each hour after that is twice the cost"". The pronoun ""that"" likely refers to the cost of the first hour. So ""twice the cost [of the first hour]"". Therefore, each subsequent hour is 80 francs.

In that case, the calculation would be:

First hour: 40

Hours 2-7: 6 hours at 80 each.

Total = 40 + (6 * 80) = 40 + 480 = 520.

But that's assuming ""twice the cost"" refers to the initial cost. If ""twice the cost"" of the previous hour, then it's the exponential case. 

This is a classic ambiguity in such problems. Let's see if there's a standard interpretation. Often in math problems, when it says ""each subsequent hour is twice the cost"", it's meant to be that each is twice the previous. So the exponential approach. However, given that the problem says ""the first paid hour is X and each hour after that is twice the cost"", it's possible that ""after that"" modifies the time, not the cost. So ""after that first hour, each hour is twice the cost"". But ""twice the cost"" of what?

Alternatively, the problem might mean that the rate after the first hour is doubled. For example, first hour is 40, and each additional hour is 80. So flat rate of 80 per hour after the first. That would make the total 40 + 6*80 = 520.

But the problem states ""each hour after that is twice the cost"". Without a reference, it's ambiguous, but perhaps the intended answer is 520. Let's check both possibilities.

If exponential:

Total is 5080, which seems high, but possible.

If linear:

Total is 520.

Which is more reasonable? Given that limo services usually don't charge exponentially increasing rates, but perhaps this is a theoretical problem. The problem might be designed to test understanding of exponential growth.

Alternatively, perhaps ""each hour after that"" refers to each hour beyond the first paid hour. So first hour 40, each next hour is twice the previous. So the problem is structured to have a geometric progression. Let's see: 7 hours. So 40 + 80 + 160 + 320 + 640 + 1280 + 2560. Which sums to 5080.

Alternatively, maybe the problem says that after the first paid hour, each hour is priced at twice the initial cost. So first hour 40, then each subsequent hour is 80. So 40 + 6*80=520.

But how to decide? Let's check how the question is phrased again:

""The first paid hour is ₣40 and each hour after that is twice the cost.""

The key is whether ""twice the cost"" refers to the previous hour's cost or the initial cost. Since it says ""each hour after that"", meaning after the first hour, each hour's cost is twice. So, if you have the first hour as 40, then the next hours are 80 each. But if ""twice the cost"" is cumulative, then each is double the prior. 

The wording is a bit ambiguous, but in math problems, such phrasing often implies that each subsequent term is double the previous. For example, if a problem says ""the first term is 2 and each term after that is three times the previous term"", that's a geometric sequence. So by analogy, here ""each hour after that is twice the cost"" would mean each subsequent hour is twice the previous one's cost. Hence, the exponential approach.

Therefore, the total cost would be 40 + 80 + 160 + 320 + 640 + 1280 + 2560 = 5080.

But let's confirm the calculation:

Let me add them step by step:

40 (hour 1)

+80 = 120 (hour 2)

+160 = 280 (hour 3)

+320 = 600 (hour 4)

+640 = 1240 (hour 5)

+1280 = 2520 (hour 6)

+2560 = 5080 (hour 7)

Yes, that's correct. So the answer would be 5080 francs.

But wait, that seems extremely expensive. But the problem might be designed that way. Let's check if there's a mistake in the initial time calculation.

He rented from 2 PM to 11 PM. That's 9 hours. Minus 2 free hours, so 7 paid hours. Correct. So 7 hours. If each hour after the first is double the previous, then the calculation is as above. So the answer is 5080.


1. **Total Rental Duration**: From 2 PM to 11 PM is 9 hours.
2. **Free Hours Deducted**: Subtract 2 free hours: \(9 - 2 = 7\) paid hours.
3. **Cost Structure**:
   - The first paid hour costs ₣40.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
4. **Hourly Costs**:
   - 1st hour: ₣40  
   - 2nd hour: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)  
   - 3rd hour: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)  
   - 4th hour: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)  
   - 5th hour: \(320 \times 2 = 640\)  
   - 6th hour: \(640 \times 2 = 1280\)  
   - 7th hour: \(1280 \times 2 = 2560\)  
5. **Total Payment**: Sum all hourly costs:  
   \(40 + 80 + 160 + 320 + 640 + 1280 + 2560 = 5080\).

66,"Nia has a flower bed that is 212 feet long. Nia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Nia's flowers grow 5 feet wide so she needs to leave 13.25 feet between every plant. Nia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₺11 at the store, how much money will Nia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Nia's flower bed is 212 feet / 13.25 feet per plant = 16 plants needed.
Nia needs to buy 16 plants - 11 plants = 5 plants needed to purchase.
Nia will spend 5 plants * ₺11 = ₺55.
#### 55","₺11. I need to find out how many more plants she needs to buy and then calculate the total cost.

First, I should determine how many plants can fit in the 212 feet. But since each plant takes up 5 feet and there's space between them, maybe I need to consider the spacing. Wait, the problem says each flower grows 5 feet wide, so the plant itself is 5 feet, and between each plant, she needs 13.25 feet. So each plant plus the space after it takes up 5 + 13.25 feet? Or is the spacing between two plants?

Wait, spacing between plants. So if she has two plants, there's one space between them. So maybe the total length is (number of plants * width of plant) + (spaces between them * spacing). So the formula would be: total length = (number of plants * 5) + ( (number of plants - 1) * 13.25 )

We need to solve for the number of plants (n) such that this total equals 212 feet.

So the equation would be:

5n + 13.25(n - 1) = 212

Let me check that. For example, if n=2, it's 5*2 +13.25*1=10+13.25=23.25, which makes sense because two plants each 5ft and one space of 13.25 between them.

So solving for n:

5n +13.25n -13.25 =212

Combine terms: (5 +13.25)n = 212 +13.25

18.25n = 225.25

Then n=225.25 /18.25

Let me compute that. Hmm, 18.25 times 12 is 219, 18.25*12=219, 225.25-219=6.25. So 6.25 /18.25 = 0.342... So n=12.342. But you can't have a fraction of a plant, so she can only fit 12 plants? But wait, maybe she can fit 12 plants, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 18.25 *12 = 219. Let's see, 225.25 divided by 18.25. Let me do it more precisely.

18.25 *12 = 219.00

225.25 -219=6.25

6.25 /18.25 = 0.34246575...

So n≈12.342. But since you can't have a fraction of a plant, she can only fit 12 plants. Wait, but maybe rounding up? Because if she puts 12 plants, the total length used would be 5*12 +13.25*(12-1)=60 +13.25*11=60 +145.75=205.75 feet. But the bed is 212 feet. So there's 212-205.75=6.25 feet left. But that's not enough to add another plant, because the next plant would need 5 feet plus another space of 13.25, but maybe the last plant doesn't need a space after it. Wait, maybe the spacing is between plants, so after the last plant, there's no need for space. So maybe the total required for n plants is 5n +13.25*(n-1). So if she can fit 12 plants, that's 205.75 feet. But there's 212-205.75=6.25 feet remaining. Can she add another plant? The next plant would need 5 feet, but since the previous spacing is already accounted for, adding another plant would require 5 feet (the plant itself) but does she need to leave space after it? If the bed is exactly 212, then if adding a 13th plant, the total would be 5*13 +13.25*(12)=65 +159=224. Which is more than 212. So she can't add 13. So the maximum number is 12 plants. Wait, but 12 plants take 205.75, which leaves 6.25 feet. But maybe she can place a 13th plant without the space after it? Let me think. If she puts 13 plants, the spacing would be between each, so 13-1=12 spaces. Then total would be 5*13 +13.25*12=65 +159=224, which is over. So that's not possible. So she can only fit 12 plants. Hmm, but this is conflicting with the earlier calculation where n≈12.34. So maybe the answer is 12 plants. But wait, let me check again. If 12 plants take 205.75 feet, which is less than 212. The remaining 6.25 feet can't accommodate another plant (needs 5 feet for plant plus 13.25 spacing), but after the 12th plant, maybe she doesn't need the spacing. Wait, maybe the spacing is between the plants. So if she has 12 plants, there are 11 spaces between them. So total length is 12*5 +11*13.25=60 +145.75=205.75. The remaining is 6.25 feet. Can she add another plant at the end without needing the spacing? Like, if the bed is 212, after the 12th plant, there's 6.25 feet left. So she could place a 13th plant if 5 feet is less than or equal to 6.25. Yes, because 5 is less than 6.25. So she can add another plant at the end, taking up 5 feet, and the remaining 1.25 feet would be unused. But the problem says she needs to leave 13.25 feet between every plant. Wait, but between each plant. If she adds the 13th plant, then between the 12th and 13th plant, there would need to be 13.25 feet. But in this case, after placing the 12th plant, the total used is 205.75, and the bed is 212. So the remaining space is 6.25 feet. To add the 13th plant, she would need to have 13.25 feet between the 12th and 13th plant, but there's only 6.25 feet left. That's not enough. So she can't add another plant. Therefore, the maximum number is 12 plants. Wait, but this is confusing. Let me re-express the problem. The total length needed for n plants is: each plant is 5ft, and between them, 13.25ft. So the formula is: (n *5) + ((n-1)*13.25) <=212. We need to find the maximum n where this holds. Let's compute for n=12: (12*5)=60, (11*13.25)=145.75. Total 205.75. 205.75 <=212: yes. For n=13: (13*5)=65, (12*13.25)=159. 65+159=224>212. So no, 13 is too much. So maximum n=12. So she can plant 12 flowers. But wait, the problem says Nia already owns 11 flowers. So she needs 12-11=1 more plant. But wait, this can't be right. Wait, because the calculation says she can fit 12 plants in total. But she already has 11. So she needs 1 more. But then the cost would be 1*11=11₺. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation for the number of plants. Let me do the equation again. The equation is 5n +13.25(n-1) =212. So 5n +13.25n -13.25=212. 18.25n=225.25. So n=225.25 /18.25. Let's compute that. 18.25 *12=219, as before. 225.25-219=6.25. So 6.25/18.25=0.3424... So n=12.342. So since you can't have 0.34 of a plant, she can fit 12 plants. Therefore, total needed is 12. She has 11. So she needs to buy 1. So cost is 11₺. But wait, maybe I should check again. Let's see. If she has 12 plants, total used is 205.75. But the bed is 212. So there's 6.25 feet left. But she can't add another plant because the required spacing is 13.25 between each, which isn't possible here. Therefore, she can only have 12. Therefore, she needs 12 total. She already has 11. So she needs 1 more. Thus, cost is 11₺. But that seems low. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me recheck. The initial equation: total length =5n +13.25(n-1). We set this equal to 212. So 5n +13.25n -13.25=212. 18.25n=212 +13.25=225.25. So n=225.25 /18.25. Let's do this division. 18.25 ×12=219. 225.25-219=6.25. 6.25 divided by 18.25 is 0.3424. So n≈12.342. So since you can't have a fraction, the maximum integer is 12. So 12 plants. She has 11, so she needs 1 more. So cost is 1×11=11₺. But wait, is there a different way to calculate this? Maybe considering that the spacing comes after each plant except the last one. So maybe the total length is (number of plants ×5) + (number of spaces ×13.25). The number of spaces is (number of plants -1). So for n=12, spaces=11. So 12×5=60, 11×13.25=145.75. Total 205.75. Which is under 212. But the remaining space is 6.25. Can she use that somehow? Like, maybe she can fit another plant without the spacing, but the problem states she needs to leave 13.25 between every plant. So between every two plants, the spacing must be 13.25. Therefore, adding another plant would require another 13.25 ft spacing. But since there's not enough space, she can't. So the answer is 12 plants. Therefore, she needs 1 more, costing 11₺. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me check with n=12.34. If that's approximately 12.34 plants, meaning 12 full plants and a part, but since you can't have part, you take 12. But maybe the problem expects rounding up? Wait, but 12.34 is over 12 but under 13. But in reality, you can't have 0.34 of a plant. So the answer is 12. So, total plants needed:12. Subtract the 11 she has. So 1. So 1×11=11. But is there a mistake here? Let me think again. Let's imagine the flower bed. Each plant is 5ft, then 13.25ft of space, then next plant, etc. The last plant doesn't need a space after it. So for n plants, the total length is 5n +13.25*(n-1). So with n=12, total is 5*12 +13.25*11=60 +145.75=205.75. Which is 212-205.75=6.25ft remaining. But she can't add another plant because even if she puts a plant in the remaining 6.25, the plant itself is 5ft, so possible, but the spacing between the previous plant and this one would need to be 13.25, but there's only 6.25 available. So that's not possible. Therefore, 12 is the max. So she needs 12, already has 11, so 1 more. So cost is 11₺. That seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 11₺.


1. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - Each plant occupies 5 feet, and 13.25 feet of space is required between adjacent plants.
   - Formula for total length: \(5n + 13.25(n - 1) = 212\), where \(n\) is the number of plants.
   - Simplify: \(18.25n - 13.25 = 212\) → \(18.25n = 225.25\) → \(n \approx 12.34\).
   - Since fractional plants are not possible, the maximum number of plants is **12**.

2. **Determine how many additional plants Nia needs to purchase:**
   - Nia already owns **11** plants.
   - Additional plants required: \(12 - 11 = 1\).

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each plant costs ₺11.
   - Total cost: \(1 \times 11 = \text{₺11}\).

68,The vending machines sell cookies for 25 cents and crackers for 75 cents. Alejandro spent ₣700 and got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change. How many crackers did he buy?,"Alejandro got ₣63.0 in change because 700 x 9/100 = 63
Alejandro spent ₣637 because 700 - 63 = 637
Alejandro spent ₣1.75 on cookies because 7 x 0.25 = 1.75
Alejandro spent 635.25 on crackers because 637.0 - 1.75 = 635.25
Alejandro bought 847 crackers because 635.25 / 0.75 = 847
#### 847","₣700 and had 9% left as change. Wait, so first, I need to figure out how much he actually spent, right? Because he didn't use all the ₣700; he has 9% remaining. 

Hmm. So if he had 9% left, that means he spent 91% of his money. Let me check that. Because 100% minus 9% is 91%. So 91% of ₣700 is what he spent. Let me calculate that. 

Calculating 91% of 700. Well, 10% of 700 is 70, so 90% would be 630. Then 1% is 7, so 91% is 630 +7 = 637. So he spent ₣637 in total on cookies and crackers.

Now, cookies are 25 cents each, and crackers are 75 cents each. But wait, the problem mentions he got 7 bags of cookies. Wait, are the prices per bag? The question says ""sell cookies for 25 cents and crackers for 75 cents."" So maybe each bag is priced at that. Wait, but the wording is a bit unclear. Wait, the problem says ""7 bags of cookies."" So maybe each bag costs 25 cents? That makes sense. So 7 bags of cookies at 25 cents each. Let's compute the total cost for the cookies first.

7 bags times 25 cents per bag. 7 * 25 = 175 cents. Wait, but the total money he spent was 637. Wait, but the units here—wait, the problem uses ₣700. The currency symbol is ₣, which I'm not sure about, but maybe it's cents? Or is it some other unit? Wait, maybe the problem is in cents. Because 25 and 75 cents are mentioned. So maybe the total amount he had was 700 cents, and he spent 637 cents. Wait, but that would make more sense. Because otherwise, if the 700 is in some other unit, maybe dollars, but then 25 cents would be fractions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using cents as the unit. Because the prices are given in cents. So the total money he had was 700 cents. So when he spent 91% of it, he spent 637 cents. So the cookies cost 25 cents per bag, he bought 7 bags, so that's 7 *25 = 175 cents. Then the remaining money spent on crackers would be 637 -175 = 462 cents. Each cracker is 75 cents, so how many can he buy with 462 cents?

So divide 462 by 75. Let's see. 75 *6 =450, which is 6 crackers for 450 cents. Then 462-450=12 cents left. But since he can't buy a fraction of a cracker, the remainder is just part of the change, but wait, the problem states that the 9% is the change left. So the total spent is exactly 637 cents, so the amount on crackers must be 462 cents exactly divisible by 75. Wait, but 75 *6 =450, 75*6.16=462? Wait, no, but 6*75=450. 462-450=12. So 12 cents left. But that would mean he has 12 cents remaining, but the problem says he had 9% left. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Because 12 cents is the remainder from 637, but according to the problem, he had 9% of the original 700 cents left. 9% of 700 is 63 cents. So this doesn't add up. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using different units. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

""Alejandro spent ₣700 and got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change.""

Wait, so he started with ₣700. After buying 7 bags of cookies and some crackers, he had 9% left. So the total amount he spent is 700 - (9% of 700). So 9% of 700 is 63. So he spent 700 -63=637. So that's correct. So he spent 637. The cookies cost 25 each (per bag?), and he bought 7 bags, so 7*25=175. Then the crackers cost 75 each. So 637 -175 =462 spent on crackers. Then 462 divided by 75 per cracker. 462 /75 is 6.16, which is not a whole number. That's a problem. Because you can't buy a fraction of a cracker. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is in dollars, and the prices are in cents. Wait, that would complicate things. Let's check. Suppose the total amount he had was 700 of some unit (let's say francs, given the symbol is ₣). The cookies are 25 cents each, crackers 75 cents. But then the units don't match. Wait, perhaps the prices are in francs. So 25 francs per cookie bag and 75 per cracker. Then 7 bags of cookies would be 7*25=175 francs. Then the remaining spent is 637-175=462 francs on crackers. Then 462/75=6.16, which again isn't whole. So that's a problem. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I miscalculated 9% of 700. Let me check that. 10% of 700 is 70, so 1% is 7. So 9% is 7*9=63. So 700-63=637. So that's correct. Then 7*25=175, so 637-175=462. 462 divided by 75 is 6.16. So maybe the problem has an error here. But the question must be answerable, so perhaps I have a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, maybe the 25 and 75 are in a different unit. Let me check the problem statement again. ""The vending machines sell cookies for 25 cents and crackers for 75 cents."" So each cookie bag is 25 cents, each cracker is 75 cents. Then, Alejandro spent a total of ₣700. Wait, but here's the confusion. The problem mentions ""Alejandro spent ₣700 and got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change."" So he started with more than ₣700? Wait, no, he spent ₣700? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse the sentence again.

""Alejandro spent ₣700 and got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change."" Wait, perhaps ""spent"" here refers to the total amount he used, but the problem says he had 9% left. So perhaps the total money he had was ₣700, and after spending some, he had 9% left. So total money: 700. Money left: 63. So money spent: 700 -63=637. Then cookies and crackers cost total 637. So cookies: 7 bags at 25 cents each: 7*25=175. Crackers: 637-175=462. 462 divided by 75 is 6.16. Which is not a whole number. Therefore, this is impossible unless the problem allows for partial crackers, which it doesn't. So this suggests that maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7 bags of cookies are not all he bought. Wait, the problem says ""got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change."" So maybe he bought 7 bags of cookies and some crackers, and the remaining money is 9% of the original. So yes, that's what we did earlier. But the calculation ends up with a fractional number of crackers. So that's a problem. 

Wait, perhaps the question is in a different currency where the denominations are such that 75 divides 462. Let me check 75 *6=450. 462-450=12. 75*6.16=462. Not possible. So maybe the problem is expecting us to ignore the remainder and take the integer part. But that would mean 6 crackers, costing 450, so total spent would be 175+450=625. Then money left is 700-625=75. 75 is what percentage of 700? 75/700=0.1071, which is 10.71%, but the problem states 9%. So that's not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo. But assuming it's correct, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the same currency unit for everything. Let me think. Let's say everything is in cents. So Alejandro had 700 cents. He spent 91% of that, so 637 cents. He bought 7 bags of cookies at 25 cents each: 7*25=175. The rest on crackers: 637-175=462. Each cracker is 75 cents. 462 ÷75=6.16. Not possible. So perhaps the answer is 6, but then the change would be 12 cents, which is not 9%. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a different currency where the amounts work out. Wait, maybe the original amount is in dollars, and the prices are in cents. So 25 cents is $0.25, and 75 cents is $0.75. Then, the total he had is $700. 9% of $700 is $63. So he spent $700 - $63 = $637. Then, cookies are $0.25 each. 7 bags would cost 7*0.25= $1.75. The rest on crackers: 637 - 1.75 = 635.25. Then each cracker is $0.75. 635.25 / 0.75 = 847. So he bought 847 crackers. But that seems a huge number. Also, converting between dollars and cents here might complicate things, but the problem states that he spent ₣700, which I'm assuming is the same currency as the prices. So this approach might not be correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake in the numbers. But since the question expects an answer, maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere. Let's see. Wait, maybe the 7 bags of cookies are part of the purchase along with the crackers, and the ""had 9% left"" is after buying both. Wait, that's what we did. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when the problem says he ""got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left"", perhaps he spent all his money except 9% on the cookies and crackers. So total money spent is 91% of 700 = 637. Then, 7 bags of cookies at 25 each and x crackers at 75 each. So equation: 25*7 +75x =637. So 175 +75x=637. 75x=637-175=462. x=462/75=6.16. Hmm. Still not a whole number. 

So either there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the 9% is of the money he spent, not the original amount. Wait, the problem states ""had 9% of his money left in change."" So his original money is 700. 9% of 700 is 63. So change is 63, so he spent 700-63=637. So that's correct. 

Wait, maybe the prices are per item, not per bag. But the problem says ""7 bags of cookies"". So perhaps each bag has multiple cookies, but the price is per cookie. But the problem says ""sell cookies for 25 cents and crackers for 75 cents"". So maybe each cookie is 25 cents, each cracker 75. But he bought 7 bags of cookies. So the number of cookies in each bag? That adds another variable. But the problem doesn't mention how many cookies per bag. So that's probably not the case. The problem probably considers each bag as a single item priced at 25 cents. 

So the only way this works is if 462 is divisible by 75. But 75*6=450, 75*6.16=462. So that's impossible. Unless there's a miscalculation. Wait, let me check 7 bags at 25: 7*25=175. Total spent is 637. 637-175=462. 462 divided by 75: 75*6=450, 462-450=12. So 12 cents left, which would be part of the 63 cents change. Wait, but the problem says that 9% of his money (63) is left. So the total change is 63. So if he spent 637, then 700-637=63. But according to our calculation, after buying 7 bags of cookies and 6 crackers, he would have 700 - (175+450) =700-625=75 left, which is 75. Which is more than 63. So there's a discrepancy here. 

Wait, perhaps the error is in the initial assumption. Let's re-express everything algebraically to check.

Let’s let C be the number of cookies (bags) and K be the number of crackers. The total cost is 25C +75K = amount spent. The total amount he had was 700. He has 9% left, so 0.09*700=63. Therefore, amount spent is 700-63=637. So equation:

25C +75K =637.

But he bought 7 bags of cookies, so C=7. Then:

25*7 +75K =637

175 +75K=637

75K=637-175=462

K=462/75=6.16

Which is not an integer, so there's a problem. Therefore, either the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing some information. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of crackers he could have bought, but that's unlikely. Or maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check once more:

Total money:700

Money left:9% of 700=63

Money spent:700-63=637

Cookies:7 bags at 25 each:7*25=175

Left for crackers:637-175=462

462 divided by 75:6.16, which is 6 crackers and 12 cents remaining. But the total change should be 63. So if he spent 637, the change is 63. But according to buying 6 crackers, he would have spent 175+450=625, and change would be 75. But 75 is more than 63. So that's conflicting.

Wait, this suggests that the problem's numbers are inconsistent. But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the problem says ""Alejandro spent ₣700 and got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change."" Oh! Wait, maybe the wording is different. Did he spend ₣700 in total, and out of that, got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of that ₣700 left? Wait, no. Because the problem says he ""spent ₣700 and got 7 bags..."". Wait, maybe the ""spent ₣700"" is the total amount he used, but then he had 9% of his money left. Wait, that would mean his original money was more than ₣700. Because he spent 700, and has 9% left. So total money is 700 + 9% of original? Wait, that's more complex.

Wait, no. Let's parse the sentence again: ""Alejandro spent ₣700 and got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change."" So he spent ₣700, but also had some change left. So his original money was 700 + change. But the change is 9% of his money. Let me define M as his original money. Then:

Amount spent =700, money left=0.09*M. Therefore:

M =700 +0.09M

So M -0.09M=700

0.91M=700

M=700/0.91≈769.23

But the problem might not be using decimal currency. So this approach might not fit. Alternatively, the problem states that he spent ₣700 and had 9% left. So total money was 700/(1-0.09)=700/0.91≈769.23. But this introduces fractions, which complicates things. Then, he bought 7 bags of cookies and some crackers. 

But this interpretation changes the problem. The initial understanding was that he started with ₣700 and spent 91% of it, but according to this new interpretation, he spent ₣700 and had 9% of his original money left, meaning his original money was more than 700. But the problem states that he ""spent ₣700 and had 9% of his money left in change"". So his total money was 700 plus 9% of his money. Let's set up the equation.

Let M be the original money. He spent 700, so remaining is M -700. But this remaining is 9% of M. So:

M -700 =0.09M

M -0.09M =700

0.91M=700

M=700/0.91≈769.23

But he can't have a fraction of a unit. So again, this approach leads to fractions. 

But then, if M≈769.23, then he spent 700, and the cookies and crackers cost 700. But he bought 7 bags of cookies at 25 each:175. So crackers cost 700-175=525. 525/75=7. So crackers would be 7. 

But wait, this works out. So 7 crackers. So answer is 7. But why? Because here, the total money he had was approximately 769.23, of which he spent 700, and had 9% of 769.23≈69.23 left, which is roughly correct. 

But the problem says he ""spent ₣700"". So according to this interpretation, he used ₣700 to buy the items and had 9% of his original money left. So the total original money is 700 +0.09M, which requires solving. But this might be the correct approach. 

But then, why did the problem mention he spent ₣700? If he spent 700, and had 9% of his original money left, then the original money is M=700 +0.09M, so M=700/0.91≈769.23. Then, the cost of cookies and crackers totals 700. He bought 7 cookies:175, so crackers cost 700-175=525. 525/75=7. So 7 crackers. 

But in this case, the answer would be 7. But this requires a different interpretation of the problem. The initial assumption was that the total money he had was 700, but this alternative interpretation says he spent 700, which is part of his total money. 

Which interpretation is correct? The problem states: ""Alejandro spent ₣700 and got 7 bags of cookies and had 9% of his money left in change."" The wording ""spent ₣700"" could mean that the total amount he spent (on cookies and crackers) is 700, and the change is 9% of his original money. Therefore, original money is 700 + 0.09*original money. So solving for original money:

Original money =700 +0.09*original money

Original money -0.09*original money=700

0.91*original money=700

Original money=700/0.91≈769.23

But this leads to fractional currency units. If we assume that the original money is 769.23, then cookies and crackers cost 700. Then 7*25=175, 700-175=525. 525/75=7. So 7 crackers. 

But this assumes that the problem's mention of ""spent ₣700"" is the total spent on the items, and the change is 9% of the original money. This seems to be a possible interpretation, and this way, the numbers work out. 

Alternatively, the problem might have a translation error or currency symbol confusion. For example, if the currency is in francs where 1 franc=100 centimes, but the prices are in centimes. So 25 centimes per cookie bag, 75 centimes per cracker. He spent 700 francs, which is 70000 centimes. But that's a stretch. 

But given that in the first interpretation, the numbers don't add up, and in the second they do, albeit with fractional original money, perhaps the intended answer is 7. Because that's the only way the math works out. 

So, to recap, if we assume that the total amount he spent is 700, and the change is 9% of his original money:

Original money =700 +0.09*original money → original money=700/0.91≈769.23. Then:

Total spent on items=700. Cookies:7*25=175. Crackers:700-175=525. 525/75=7. So 7 crackers.

Thus, the answer is 7. 

But why would the problem phrase it as ""Alejandro spent ₣700 and had 9% of his money left""? That phrasing is a bit confusing, but maybe it's implying that the 9% is from the original amount. So despite the fractional original money, this is the only way to get an integer number of crackers. Hence, the answer is 7.


1. **Determine total money spent**: Alejandro had 9% of his money left, meaning he spent 91% of his original amount.  
   - Original money = ₣700  
   - Money spent = 700 × (1 - 0.09) = 700 × 0.91 = ₣637  

2. **Calculate cost of cookies**: He bought 7 bags of cookies at 25 cents each.  
   - Cost of cookies = 7 × 25 = ₣175  

3. **Find remaining money for crackers**: Subtract the cost of cookies from the total spent.  
   - Money left for crackers = 637 - 175 = ₣462  

4. **Compute number of crackers**: Each cracker costs 75 cents.  
   - Number of crackers = 462 ÷ 75 = 6.16 (fractional result, implying inconsistency)  

5. **Reinterpret the problem**: If ""spent ₣700"" refers to the total expenditure (with 9% of *original* money as change):  
   - Let original money = \( M \).  
   - Equation: \( M - 700 = 0.09M \) → \( M = 700 / 0.91 ≈ ₣769.23 \).  
   - Total spent = ₣700.  
   - Cost of crackers = 700 - (7 × 25) = 700 - 175 = ₣525.  
   - Number of crackers = 525 ÷ 75 = 7.

Each flowering plant costs ₣8 at the store, how much money will Quinn spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Quinn's flower bed is 189 meters / 13.5 meters per plant = 14 plants needed.
Quinn needs to buy 14 plants - 13 plants = 1 plants needed to purchase.
Quinn will spend 1 plants * ₣8 = ₣8.
#### 8","₣8, so we need to find out how many more she needs to buy and then calculate the total cost.

First, maybe I should figure out how much space each plant plus the required spacing takes up. Wait, the spacing is between each plant, right? So if she plants one flower, does she need space after it? Or does the spacing start after the first plant? Hmm. Let me think. If she has multiple plants, each plant is 5 meters wide, and between every two plants, there's 13.5 meters. So the total length for n plants would be the sum of all the plant widths plus the spaces between them.

For example, if she has 2 plants, it would be 5 + 13.5 + 5 = 23.5 meters. Wait, the first plant is 5m, then 13.5m space, then the second plant. So for each additional plant after the first, she needs to add 13.5m + 5m. So maybe the formula is 5 + (n-1)*(5 +13.5). Let me check that. For 1 plant: 5m. For 2 plants: 5 + (13.5 +5) = 5 +18.5=23.5, which matches. For 3 plants: 5 + 2*(18.5) =5 +37=42. So yes, that formula works. So total length required for n plants is 5 + (n-1)*(18.5). Let's write that as Total length = 5 + (n-1)*18.5.

But she has a total flower bed of 189 meters. So we need to find the maximum number of plants (n) such that the total length does not exceed 189 meters. So solving 5 + (n-1)*18.5 ≤ 189.

Let's solve for n. Subtract 5: (n-1)*18.5 ≤ 184. Then divide both sides by 18.5: n-1 ≤ 184 /18.5. Let me calculate that. 184 divided by 18.5. Hmm, 18.5 times 9 is 166.5. 18.5*10=185. So 184 is 185 -1, so 10 - (1/18.5) ≈9.9459. So n-1 ≈9.9459, so n≈10.9459. Since n must be an integer, we take the floor, so n=10+1=11? Wait, wait. Wait, let me do the division properly. 184 ÷18.5.

Another way: 184 divided by 18.5. Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal: 368/37. Let's divide 368 by 37. 37*9=333, 368-333=35. So 35/37 is about 0.9459. So 368/37≈9.9459. So (n-1)≈9.9459. Therefore, n-1=9.9459. Since n must be a whole number (can't have a fraction of a plant), we take the integer part, which is 9. So n-1=9, so n=10. Wait, but 9.9459 is almost 10. So maybe we can fit 10 intervals. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Total length =5 + (n-1)*18.5 ≤189.

Let me rearrange:

(n-1)*18.5 ≤184 → n-1 ≤184/18.5.

Calculating 184 ÷18.5. Let's see:

18.5 * 10 =185. So 184 is 1 less than 185. So 184 is 18.5*9.9459. So n-1 is approximately 9.9459. Since you can't have a fraction of a plant spacing, we need to take the floor of that, which is 9. So n=10. Let me check: For n=10, total length is 5 +9*18.5. Let's compute 9*18.5: 18*9=162, 0.5*9=4.5, so total 166.5. 5+166.5=171.5 meters. That's way less than 189. So maybe that's not correct. Wait, because 184/18.5 is approximately 9.9459, which is almost 10. So perhaps n-1=9.9459, meaning that n=10.9459. So you can fit 10 full intervals, but maybe there's some space left. Wait, maybe the calculation is wrong. Let me try again.

Wait, another approach: Each plant after the first takes up 5m +13.5m =18.5m. So the first plant is 5m, and each subsequent plant adds 18.5m. So the total length for n plants is 5 +18.5*(n-1) ≤189.

So solving for n:

5 +18.5(n-1) ≤189

18.5(n-1) ≤184

n-1 ≤184/18.5

184 divided by 18.5: Let's compute that. 18.5 × 10 = 185, which is 1 more than 184, so 184/18.5 =9.9459 approximately. So n-1=9.9459 → n=10.9459. But since we can't have a fraction of a plant, the maximum integer n is 10. So n=10. Wait, but then when n=10, total length is 5 +18.5*9 =5 +166.5=171.5m. Which is less than 189. Then there is 189-171.5=17.5 meters left. But can we add another plant? Wait, after the 10th plant, how much space would the next plant require? To add an 11th plant, we need to add another 18.5m (5m plant plus 13.5m spacing). But 171.5 +18.5=190, which exceeds 189. So no, can't add another. So maximum number is 10. Hmm. But that leaves 17.5 meters unused. But maybe there's a way to adjust. Wait, perhaps the spacing is only between plants. So if you have the last plant, do you need to leave spacing after it? Because if the spacing is between plants, then the last plant doesn't need spacing. So maybe the total length is (number of plants *5) + (number of spaces *13.5). The number of spaces would be (n-1), because between each pair of plants. For example, 2 plants have 1 space between them. So total length =5n +13.5*(n-1). Let's check that. For 1 plant: 5*1 +13.5*(0)=5. Correct. For 2 plants:5*2 +13.5*1=10+13.5=23.5. Which matches the earlier example. For 3 plants:5*3 +13.5*2=15+27=42. Correct. So the formula should be total length =5n +13.5(n-1). Let's use this formula instead.

So, using this formula, we can write:

5n +13.5(n-1) ≤189.

Let's compute that:

5n +13.5n -13.5 ≤189.

Combine terms: (5+13.5)n -13.5 ≤189 → 18.5n -13.5 ≤189.

Add 13.5 to both sides: 18.5n ≤189 +13.5 =202.5.

So n ≤202.5 /18.5.

Calculate that:

202.5 ÷18.5. Let me compute:

18.5 ×10=185

18.5×11=185+18.5=203.5

But 202.5 is 1 less than 203.5. So 202.5=18.5×10 +17.5. Because 18.5×10=185, 202.5-185=17.5.

17.5 /18.5 ≈0.9459. So 202.5/18.5 ≈10.9459.

Thus, n can be at maximum 10.9459, so since n must be integer, the maximum n is 10. Because 10.9459 is approximately 10.9459, so the integer part is 10. Let's check with n=10:

Total length =5*10 +13.5*(10-1) =50 +13.5*9 =50 +121.5=171.5. Which matches the previous calculation. So 171.5 meters, and the bed is 189. So 189-171.5=17.5 meters left. But can we fit another plant? Let's check n=11:

Total length =5*11 +13.5*10 =55 +135=190. Which is over 189. So no. So the maximum number of plants Quinn can fit is 10. But wait, Quinn already owns 13 flowers. Wait, that's a problem! Because she can only fit 10 plants, but she already has 13. Wait, that can't be. Wait, this doesn't make sense. If she can only fit 10 plants, but she already has 13, then she doesn't need to buy any. But that seems odd. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the problem states that Quinn's flowers grow 5 meters wide, so each plant takes up 5m. She needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant. So when planting, each plant is 5m, then 13.5m gap. So the formula is correct as 5n +13.5(n-1). But according to that, she can only fit 10 plants. But she already has 13, which would require more space than the bed. That's a contradiction, unless I messed up the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving the equation. Let's redo the equation:

Total length required =5n +13.5(n-1) ≤189

So 5n +13.5n -13.5 ≤189

18.5n -13.5 ≤189

18.5n ≤189 +13.5 =202.5

n ≤202.5 /18.5

Let me compute 202.5 divided by 18.5. Let me use a calculator approach:

18.5 ×10 =185

Subtract 185 from 202.5: 202.5 -185=17.5

So 17.5 left. 18.5 ×0.9459 ≈17.5. So 17.5/18.5≈0.9459. So total n≈10.9459.

So maximum integer n=10. But Quinn already has 13 flowers, which would need a total length of 5*13 +13.5*(12) =65 +162=227 meters. Which is way longer than 189. So that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. Wait, but the problem states that Quinn wants to fill her flower bed with plants. So perhaps the 13 flowers she already has are not yet planted? Or maybe the problem is that she can't use all 13 because the bed is too short. So she can only plant 10, but she has 13, which is more than needed, so she doesn't need to buy any. But that would mean she has enough. Wait, but that contradicts the problem's statement. Wait, let's read the problem again:

""Quinn has a flower bed that is 189 meters long. Quinn wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Quinn's flowers grow 5 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant. Quinn already owns 13 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣8 at the store, how much money will Quinn spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?""

Ah, the problem is that she needs to fill the entire 189 meters. But she already has 13 flowers. So first, we need to determine how many plants are needed to fill the 189m bed, and then subtract the 13 she already has. But if the total number of plants needed is 10, but she has 13, then she doesn't need to buy any. But that seems counterintuitive. But according to the calculation, the maximum number of plants she can fit is 10. Therefore, she already has more than needed. But that's impossible because 13 plants would require 5*13 +13.5*(12) =65 +162=227 meters, which is way longer than 189. So there's a mistake here. So perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the spacing is 13.5 meters between plants, meaning that between the centers of the plants, but that would change the calculation. But the problem states ""needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant."" So perhaps the spacing is from the end of one plant to the start of the next. Since each plant is 5 meters wide, the distance between the start of one plant and the start of the next would be 5 +13.5 =18.5 meters. So each plant plus spacing occupies 18.5 meters. But the first plant starts at 0, ends at 5. Then the next plant starts at 5 +13.5 =18.5, ends at 18.5 +5 =23.5. Then the next starts at 23.5 +13.5 =37, ends at 42, etc. Wait, this way, each plant is spaced 13.5 meters apart from the previous one (edge to edge). So the distance between the start of one plant and the start of the next is 5 +13.5 =18.5 meters. So if there are n plants, the total length occupied would be (n-1)*18.5 +5 meters. Because the first plant takes 5m, and each subsequent plant adds 18.5m. So total length is 5 +18.5*(n-1). Which brings us back to the initial formula. So for n=10, 5 +18.5*9=5 +166.5=171.5. But the bed is 189m. So there's 189 -171.5=17.5m left. Can we fit another plant? If the next plant would start at 171.5m, then it needs 5m, but the bed is 189m. 171.5 +5=176.5, which is within 189. But wait, no, because according to the spacing rules, the next plant would need to be placed 13.5m after the previous one. Wait, the last plant ends at 171.5m (since total length is 171.5). So the next plant would start at 171.5 +13.5 =185m, and end at 185 +5=190m. But the bed is only 189m. So that's too long. Therefore, you can't fit another plant. Therefore, the maximum number is 10. So she needs 10 plants. But she already has 13. So she has more than enough. Wait, that's impossible. Because 13 plants can't even fit in the bed. So this suggests that the problem has a mistake, or I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says: ""Quinn's flowers grow 5 meters wide so she needs to leave 13.5 meters between every plant."" So each flower is 5m wide, and between every two plants, there's 13.5m. Quinn already owns 13 flowers. But the flower bed is 189m. She wants to fill it with plants. So she can only fit 10 plants. Therefore, even though she has 13, she can't use them all. But the question is asking how much money she will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed. If she can only fit 10 plants, but she already has 13, then she already has more than enough. But that's impossible. Wait, maybe the problem meant that each plant is 5m wide and requires 13.5m between them, but she wants to fill the entire bed. So perhaps the spacing is not required after the last plant? So maybe the total length is 5n +13.5(n-1). Which for n=10 gives 171.5. But the bed is 189m. So she needs to fill the remaining 17.5m. Can she adjust the spacing? But the problem says she needs to leave 13.5m between every plant. So perhaps she can't adjust the spacing. So she can't use the remaining 17.5m. Therefore, she can only plant 10 plants, and thus, even though she has 13, she needs to plant 10, so she has enough (but she already has 13, so she has more than needed). Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. But that seems odd. So the answer would be zero. But maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the problem again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial calculation. Let me try solving the equation again for the correct formula. Let's use the formula total length =5n +13.5(n-1) ≤189.

Which is 5n +13.5n -13.5 ≤189 → 18.5n -13.5 ≤189 →18.5n ≤202.5 →n ≤202.5/18.5=10.9459. So the maximum integer n is 10. Therefore, she needs 10 plants. She already has 13, so she has 3 more than needed. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. So the total cost is 0. But that's the case if the problem is as stated. However, this seems counterintuitive because having more plants than fit doesn't make sense. But perhaps the question implies that she wants to plant as many as possible, and even though she has more, she can't use them. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. So the answer would be zero. But I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in translating the problem requirements into the formula. Let's confirm:

Each plant is 5m wide. Between every two plants, there's 13.5m. So for n plants, the total length is:

For 1 plant:5m

For 2 plants:5 +13.5 +5 =23.5m

For 3 plants:5 +13.5 +5 +13.5 +5 =5*3 +13.5*2=15+27=42m

So the formula is correct as 5n +13.5(n-1).

Thus, solving for n:

5n +13.5(n-1)=189 →18.5n -13.5=189 →18.5n=202.5 →n=202.5/18.5=10.9459. So 10 full plants. But she has 13. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. So the answer is 0.

But this seems odd. Let me check with another approach. Suppose she plants all 13 flowers she has. What's the required length?

Total length =5*13 +13.5*(12) =65 +162=227m. Which is longer than 189. So she can't plant all 13. Therefore, the maximum she can plant is 10. She has 13, so she can use 10 and has 3 left over. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. Hence, the cost is 0. So the answer is 0.

But maybe the question is that she wants to fill the entire bed, meaning using all 189 meters, and if she can't fill it exactly, she needs to plant as many as possible. But the problem states ""fill up her flower bed"", which might mean to plant as many as possible, not to fill every centimeter. So she plants 10, which requires 171.5m, and the remaining 17.5m is left empty. But the problem says she wants to ""fill her flower bed with plants"". Maybe she wants to cover the entire length exactly. That would require adjusting the spacing. But the problem states she needs to leave 13.5m between every plant. So she can't adjust the spacing. Therefore, she can only plant 10. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any. Therefore, answer is 0.

But this seems counterintuitive. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the spacing. Wait, maybe the 13.5m is between the plants, from center to center? That would change things. Or perhaps the spacing is from edge to edge. Let me think differently. Suppose each plant takes up 5m in width and requires 13.5m of space between adjacent plants. So the distance between the centers of two adjacent plants would be 5/2 +13.5 +5/2=13.5 +5=18.5m. But this is perhaps irrelevant. The key is that the total length required is 5n +13.5(n-1). So regardless of where the spacing is measured from, the total required length is 5n +13.5(n-1). Which, as calculated, gives 10 plants for 189m. Therefore, answer is 0. But this feels wrong. Let me check with another approach.

Alternative approach:

Each plant plus its following space is 5 +13.5=18.5m, except the last plant which doesn't need a space after it. So for n plants, total length is (n-1)*18.5 +5. So the same as before. So n=10 plants give 171.5m. So she can't use all 189m. Therefore, she plants 10. She has 13, so she uses 10, needs no more. Therefore, cost is 0.

Therefore, the answer is 0. But maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the spacing is between the plants, so the total required is (n-1)*13.5 +5n. Which is what I've been using. So yes.

So the correct answer is that Quinn needs to buy 0 plants, so she spends 0 francs.


1. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - Each plant occupies 5 meters, and 13.5 meters of spacing is required between every two plants.
   - Total length formula for \( n \) plants: \( 5n + 13.5(n-1) \leq 189 \).
   - Simplify: \( 5n + 13.5n - 13.5 \leq 189 \rightarrow 18.5n - 13.5 \leq 189 \).
   - Solve for \( n \): \( 18.5n \leq 202.5 \rightarrow n \leq \frac{202.5}{18.5} \approx 10.945 \).
   - Maximum integer \( n = 10 \) plants.

2. **Compare with existing plants:**
   - Quinn already owns 13 plants.
   - The flower bed can only accommodate 10 plants, so she cannot use all 13. No additional plants are needed.

3. **Calculate the cost:**
   - Number of plants to buy = \( 10 - 13 = -3 \), which means no purchase is required.
   - Total cost = \( 0 \times ₣8 = ₣0 \).

\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \, \text{cents} \]  

Step 3: Derive the remaining amount spent on cookies.  
Total spent on popcorn and cookies:  
\[ 350 + 125x = 1200 \]  
where \( x \) is the number of cookies.  

Step 4: Solve for \( x \).  
\[ 125x = 1200 - 350 \]  
\[ 125x = 850 \]  
\[ x = \frac{850}{125} = 6.8 \]  

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the problem's parameters are inconsistent (fractional cookies). This suggests a potential error in the problem's setup, but forcing the closest valid integer gives \( x = 7 \). However, the correct answer based on strict calculation and problem constraints is unattainable with given data.

Answer: 
The calculation results in a non-integer value (6.8), indicating inconsistency in the problem. Adjusting for realism or assuming a typo, the closest integer is **7**, though no valid solution exists.

74,Ibrahim is rolling a d4 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 3 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 4 = 75%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 75% - 25% = 50%.
#### 50","1. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 (Event A):**  
   A d4 die has outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4}. Numbers greater than 1 are {2, 3, 4}, so there are 3 favorable outcomes.  
   \( P(A) = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \).

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row (Event B):**  
   Odd numbers on a d4 are {1, 3}, giving 2 favorable outcomes in one roll. For two independent rolls:  
   \( P(\text{odd in one roll}) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).  
   \( P(B) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \).

3. **Determine how much more likely Event A is compared to Event B:**  
   Compute the percentage difference relative to Event B:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{P(A) - P(B)}{P(B)}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{0.75 - 0.25}{0.25}\right) \times 100\% = 200\%.

76,"Sofia has a flower bed that is 200 feet long. Sofia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Sofia's flowers grow 7 feet wide so she needs to leave 12.5 feet between every plant. Sofia already owns 13 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₺12 at the store, how much money will Sofia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Sofia's flower bed is 200 feet / 12.5 feet per plant = 16 plants needed.
Sofia needs to buy 16 plants - 13 plants = 3 plants needed to purchase.
Sofia will spend 3 plants * ₺12 = ₺36.
#### 36","₺12. We need to find out how much more money she needs to spend to fill up the bed.

First, I think I need to figure out how many plants can fit in the 200-foot bed. Each plant takes up some space, and there's space between them. Wait, the flowers are 7 feet wide, and the space between them is 12.5 feet. So for each plant after the first one, there's 12.5 feet of space before the next plant. Let me visualize this. 

If she plants the first flower, it takes up 7 feet. Then the next one has 12.5 feet of space and then another 7 feet for the plant. So each subsequent plant adds 12.5 + 7 feet. So maybe the total length is 7 feet for the first plant, plus (number of plants -1) multiplied by (7 +12.5). Wait, no, because the space is between plants. So the correct formula is: total length = (number of plants) * 7 + (number of plants -1) * 12.5. Because each space is between two plants, so one less space than the number of plants.

So we can set up the equation: 7n + 12.5(n-1) = 200. Let me check that. Let's say n is the number of plants. Each plant is 7 feet, so 7n. The spaces between them are 12.5 each, and there are (n-1) spaces. So yes, total length is 7n +12.5(n-1). That should equal 200.

So solving for n. Let's compute that. 7n +12.5n -12.5 = 200. Combine like terms: (7 +12.5)n -12.5 =200. That's 19.5n -12.5 =200. Then 19.5n = 200 +12.5 =212.5. So n=212.5 /19.5. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 212.5 divided by 19.5. Let me see, 19.5 times 10 is 195, subtract that from 212.5, we have 17.5 left. 19.5 goes into 17.5 how many times? Hmm, 0.9 maybe. So 10.9... approximately. Wait, but maybe exact calculation. Let's do it as fractions. 212.5 is 425/2, 19.5 is 39/2. So dividing 425/2 by 39/2 is 425/39. Let me compute 425 ÷39. 39*10=390, 425-390=35. So 35/39. So total n=10 +35/39 ≈10.897. Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, she can only plant 10 whole plants? Wait, but wait, that would be less than 200. Wait, maybe we need to check if 10 plants fit or 11. Because you can't have part of a plant, so we need to see which number of plants (10 or 11) doesn't exceed the 200 feet.

Let me test n=10. Then total length is 7*10 +12.5*(10-1) =70 +12.5*9=70 +112.5=182.5. That's less than 200. What about n=11? 7*11=77, 12.5*10=125. 77+125=202. That's over 200. So 11 plants would require 202 feet, which is too long. So she can only fit 10 plants. Wait, but that seems wrong because 10 plants only take 182.5 feet, leaving over 17.5 feet. But maybe the problem is that she needs to fill the entire bed. Wait, the problem says ""fill up her flower bed"". So perhaps she wants to plant as many as possible without exceeding the length. But the answer seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate. 7n +12.5(n-1) =200. Let's compute for n=10: 7*10=70, 12.5*9=112.5. 70+112.5=182.5. Which is under 200. For n=11: 7*11=77, 12.5*10=125. 77+125=202. Which is over 200. So she can't fit 11 plants. Therefore, the maximum number of plants she can fit is 10. But then, the flower bed is 200 feet, and she's only using 182.5. So maybe the problem expects her to use the entire space. Hmm, but if that's not possible, then she can only put 10. But the problem states that she wants to ""fill her flower bed"", which might imply she uses the whole space. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the spacing is only between the plants, so maybe the total length is different. Let's re-examine.

Another way to think: the first plant starts at 0 and ends at 7. Then the next starts at 7+12.5=19.5, ends at 19.5+7=26.5. Wait, no. Wait, between the end of one plant and the start of the next is 12.5 feet. So the centers would be spaced 12.5 feet apart, but maybe the plant's width is 7, so the space between plants is 12.5 feet. So the total between the end of one plant and the start of the next is 12.5 feet. So, for example, plant 1 ends at 7 feet. Then the next plant starts at 7 +12.5 =19.5 feet. The second plant ends at 19.5 +7=26.5. So each plant after the first adds 12.5 +7 feet. So total length for n plants is 7 + (n-1)*(12.5+7). Let me check that. For n=2: 7 +1*(19.5) =26.5. Which is correct. So the formula would be 7 + (n-1)*(19.5) = total length. Wait, 12.5 spacing plus 7 feet for the next plant. So each additional plant after the first adds 19.5 feet. So total length is 7 + (n-1)*19.5.

So set that equal to 200. 7 +19.5(n-1) =200. Subtract 7: 19.5(n-1)=193. Then n-1=193/19.5. Let's compute 193 ÷19.5. 19.5*9=175.5, 193-175.5=17.5. So 17.5/19.5=0.897. So n-1=9.897, so n≈10.897. So again, n≈10.897. So since you can't have a fraction, the maximum number of plants is 10, which would give a total length of 7 +19.5*9=7+175.5=182.5. Which again, is less than 200. So she can't fit 11. But the problem says ""fill her flower bed"". So maybe the question allows the last plant to have less space? But the problem states that she needs to leave 12.5 feet between every plant. So the spacing is required between every pair. So the answer would be 10 plants. But Sofia already owns 13 flowers. Wait, that's a problem. Because if she can only fit 10 plants in the bed, but she already has 13, then she has more than enough. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I messed up the problem.

Wait, wait. Wait, Sofia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. The flowers are 7 feet wide each, and between each plant she needs to leave 12.5 feet. She already has 13 flowers. The question is how much money she needs to spend to fill the bed. So first, we need to find how many plants can fit in the 200-foot bed. If the maximum is 10, but she already has 13, then she has more than enough. But that can't be. So there's a mistake here. Because 13 flowers would take up more space than 200 feet. Wait, but maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, let's recalculate the number of plants. Let me try again. If each plant is 7 feet, and spacing is 12.5 feet between them, then for n plants, the total length is 7n +12.5(n-1). Which is 7n +12.5n -12.5=19.5n -12.5. So 19.5n -12.5 =200. Then 19.5n=212.5 → n=212.5 /19.5. Let me compute that. 19.5 *10 =195, 19.5*11=214.5. But 212.5 is between 10 and 11. So 212.5 -195=17.5. 17.5 divided by 19.5 is approximately 0.897. So n≈10.897. So 10 full plants. But Sofia already has 13. That's more than 10. So she already has more than she can plant. So she doesn't need to buy any. But that seems odd. But according to the calculation, the flower bed can only fit 10 plants. But Sofia already owns 13. So she can't plant all 13 because the bed isn't long enough. Therefore, she can only plant 10. So she doesn't need to buy any more plants. But that would mean she spends 0. But that seems strange. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong. Maybe I inverted the spacing. Let me think again. Let's say the spacing is between the centers of the plants. No, probably the spacing is between the edges. So after one plant ends at 7 feet, the next one starts at 7 +12.5 =19.5. So the first plant is 0 to7, then next is 19.5 to26.5, etc. So each plant after the first one requires 12.5 +7 feet. So total length is 7 + (n-1)*(12.5+7). Which is 7 + (n-1)*19.5. So for n plants, the total length is 7 +19.5(n-1). Let's compute that for n=10: 7 +19.5*9=7+175.5=182.5. For n=11:7 +19.5*10=7+195=202. Which exceeds 200. So maximum is 10 plants. 

But Sofia already has 13 flowers. So she can't plant all 13. She can only plant 10. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any more. Thus, the cost would be 0. But that seems counterintuitive. Wait, but the problem says ""fill her flower bed"". If she can't plant all 13, but only 10, then she would need to plant 10. But she already has 13, which is more than enough. So she doesn't need to buy any. But maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the problem is that the spacing is between the centers of the plants. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the spacing is 12.5 feet between the plants, meaning the space between the edges. Wait, if each plant is 7 feet wide, and between them is 12.5 feet, then from the end of one plant to the start of the next is 12.5 feet. So the centers would be spaced 7/2 +12.5 +7/2 =12.5 +7=19.5 feet apart. So the total length for n plants is (n-1)*19.5 +7. Which is the same as before. So the calculation holds. So 10 plants, 182.5 feet. 

But the problem says ""fill up her flower bed"". If the bed is 200 feet, and she can only fit 10 plants, then perhaps the answer is that she doesn't need to buy any. But maybe the problem expects that the spacing is allowed to be less for the last plant. For example, maybe the last plant can be placed without the spacing after it. Wait, but the problem states that she needs to leave 12.5 feet between every plant. So between every two plants, there's 12.5 feet. So if there are n plants, there are n-1 spaces. So the total length is 7n +12.5(n-1). For example, if n=1, total length is 7. If n=2, 14 +12.5=26.5. Which is 7*2 +12.5*1. Yes. So that formula is correct. 

Therefore, solving 19.5n -12.5=200. So n= (200+12.5)/19.5 =212.5/19.5≈10.897. So she can fit 10 plants. Since she already has 13, which is more than 10, she doesn't need to buy any. Therefore, the answer is 0. But the problem says ""fill up her flower bed"", which might imply she wants to use all the space, but according to the calculations, she can't fit more than 10 plants. 

Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the math again. 

Original equation: 7n +12.5(n-1) =200

So 7n +12.5n -12.5 =200

19.5n =212.5

n=212.5 /19.5

Dividing 212.5 by 19.5:

19.5 ×10 =195

212.5 -195=17.5

17.5 /19.5 =0.897...

So n≈10.897. So 10.897 plants. Since you can't have a fraction, she can have 10 plants. But that leaves unused space. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows partial plants, but that's not logical. So the answer would be 10 plants. But Sofia has 13, which is more than enough. So she doesn't need to buy any. Therefore, the cost is 0. 

But the problem seems to suggest that she needs to buy more. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the spacing. Wait, maybe the 12.5 feet is between the centers of the plants. Let me try that approach. 

If the spacing between centers is 12.5 feet, then the total distance between centers would be 12.5 feet. But each plant is 7 feet wide. So the distance between the edges would be 12.5 - (7/2 +7/2) =12.5 -7 =5.5 feet. But that would complicate things. But the problem says ""leave 12.5 feet between every plant"". So probably, the space between the plants is 12.5 feet. So from the end of one plant to the start of the next is 12.5 feet. So the calculation is correct as before. 

Therefore, the answer should be 0. But this seems odd. Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Sofia's flowers grow 7 feet wide, so each plant takes up 7 feet in width. The spacing between plants is 12.5 feet. So for each plant after the first, the total required space is 7 (plant) +12.5 (space). The first plant takes 7 feet. So the formula is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the spacing is between the plants, so the total required per plant (including spacing) is 7 +12.5 =19.5 feet. Except for the last plant. So total length would be (n-1)*19.5 +7. Which is the same as before. So no, the calculation holds. 

So conclusion: Sofia can plant 10 flowers, requiring 182.5 feet. She already has 13 flowers, which is more than needed. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any more. So the cost is 0. 

But maybe the problem expects that the spacing is after each plant, including the last one. That is, perhaps the total length is 7n +12.5n. But that would be if there's spacing after each plant, including the last. But that would mean the bed ends with a space, which doesn't make sense. For example, if you have two plants, it's plant + space + plant + space. No, that can't be right. The spacing is between plants, so for n plants, there are n-1 spaces. Therefore, the formula is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is 0. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. If Sofia has 13 flowers, but can only plant 10, she already has enough. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any more. So the total cost is 0. So the answer is 0. 

But wait, the problem says ""fill her flower bed"". If she can't fit all 13, but can only plant 10, then she's not using all her existing flowers. But the question is about filling the bed, not using all her flowers. So she needs to fill the bed with plants, and she has 13, but only 10 can fit. So she uses 10, and doesn't need to buy more. So the cost is 0. 

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the answer is 0.


1. **Determine the total space each plant requires including spacing:**  
   Each plant is 7 feet wide with 12.5 feet of spacing after it (except the last plant). For \( n \) plants, the total length is:  
   \[
   7n + 12.5(n - 1) = 200
   \]

2. **Solve for \( n \):**  
   Combine terms:  
   \[
   19.5n - 12.5 = 200 \implies 19.5n = 212.5 \implies n = \frac{212.5}{19.5} \approx 10.897
   \]  
   Since \( n \) must be a whole number, Sofia can only fit **10 plants** without exceeding the bed length.

3. **Compare with existing plants:**  
   Sofia already owns 13 plants. Since only 10 plants fit in the 200-foot bed, she has **more than enough plants** and does not need to buy additional ones.

4. **Calculate the cost:**  
   Required plants = 10, owned plants = 13. No additional purchases are needed. Total cost = \( 0 \times ₺12 = ₺0 \).

Then add the peeling time to find the total time Olivia spends: 14 minutes + 9 minutes = 23 minutes
#### 23","1. **Peeling Time Calculation**: Olivia can peel 10 mushrooms per minute. To peel 90 mushrooms, the time required is \( \frac{90}{10} = 9 \) minutes. However, if peeling overlaps with sautéing, the total time can be reduced.

2. **Sautéing Time Calculation**: Sautéing 45 mushrooms takes 7 minutes. For 90 mushrooms, two batches are needed, totaling \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) minutes. However, if the second batch starts immediately after the first, the total time depends on overlapping.

3. **Overlapping Tasks**:
   - **First Batch**: Olivia peels 45 mushrooms in \( \frac{45}{10} = 4.5 \) minutes. She starts sautéing this batch at 4.5 minutes, which finishes at \( 4.5 + 7 = 11.5 \) minutes.
   - **Second Batch**: While the first batch is sautéing (7 minutes from 4.5 to 11.5 minutes), she peels the remaining 45 mushrooms. This takes \( \frac{45}{10} = 4.5 \) minutes, finishing at \( 4.5 + 4.5 = 9 \) minutes.
   - **Second Sauté**: After the first sauté finishes at 11.5 minutes, the second batch is sautéed for another 7 minutes, ending at \( 11.5 + 7 = 18.5 \) minutes.

4. **Total Time**: The total time is determined by the completion of the second sauté, which occurs at 18.5 minutes.

81,James is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"There are 16 numbers greater than 4 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 16 / 20 = 80%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 80% - 25% = 55%.
#### 55","Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a d20.  
Numbers greater than 4: 5 to 20 (16 outcomes).  
Probability = 16/20 = 4/5 = 0.8.

Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.  
Even numbers on a d20: 10 outcomes (2, 4, 6, ..., 20).  
Single-roll probability = 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.  
Two-roll probability = 0.5 × 0.5 = 1/4 = 0.25.

Step 3: Determine how much more likely the first event is compared to the second.  
Difference in probabilities = 0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55.  
Percentage increase = (0.55 / 0.25) × 100% = 220%.

82,"Yuki caught 6 steelheads last Wednesday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 68 kilograms, the second steelhead he caught weighs 53 kilograms, and the last steelhead he caught weighs 27 kilograms. If a kilogram of steelhead costs €1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Yuki will earn 68 x €1.0 = €68.0 from the first steelhead.
He will earn 53 x €1.0 = €53.0 for the second steelhead.
The rest of the steelheads are 6-2 = 4. He will earn 27 x €1.0 = €27.0 per each of them. So he will earn 4 * 27.0 = =108.0
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is €68.0 + €53.0 + €108.0= €229.
#### 229","1. Yuki caught a total of 6 steelheads. The weights provided are for the first (68 kg), second (53 kg), and last (assumed sixth, 27 kg) steelheads. The weights of the third, fourth, and fifth steelheads are not given.  
2. Since the problem does not specify the missing weights, there is insufficient information to calculate the exact total weight of all 6 steelheads. However, assuming the problem contains a typo and Yuki actually caught 3 steelheads (with the ""last"" referring to the third), the total weight would be \(68 + 53 + 27 = 148\) kg.  
3. At €1.0 per kilogram, the earnings would be \(148 \times 1.0 = €148\).

83,"Yara has a flower bed that is 168 feet long. Yara wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Yara's flowers grow 7 feet wide so she needs to leave 14.0 feet between every plant. Yara already owns 10 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €13 at the store, how much money will Yara spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Yara's flower bed is 168 feet / 14.0 feet per plant = 12 plants needed.
Yara needs to buy 12 plants - 10 plants = 2 plants needed to purchase.
Yara will spend 2 plants * €13 = €26.
#### 26","1. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - Each plant is 7 feet wide, and 14 feet of spacing is required between adjacent plants.
   - For \( N \) plants, the total length used is \( 7N + 14(N-1) \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( 7N + 14(N-1) = 21N - 14 \).
   - Set \( 21N - 14 \leq 168 \) (flower bed length).
   - Solve for \( N \):
     \[
     21N \leq 182 \implies N \leq \frac{182}{21} \approx 8.67
     \]
   - Since \( N \) must be an integer, the maximum number of plants is **8**.

2. **Compare with Yara's existing flowers:**
   - Yara already owns 10 flowers, but only 8 can fit in the flower bed.
   - She does not need to buy additional plants because she already has more than the required 8.

3. **Calculate the cost:**
   - The number of plants to purchase is \( 8 - 10 = -2 \), which means no additional plants are needed.
   - Total cost: \( 0 \times €13 = €0 \).

84,The vending machines sell gum for 80 cents and cookies for 100 cents. Umar spent ₺900 and got 5 bags of gum and had 1% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?,"Umar got ₺9.0 in change because 900 x 1/100 = 9
Umar spent ₺891 because 900 - 9 = 891
Umar spent ₺4.0 on gum because 5 x 0.8 = 4.0
Umar spent 887.0 on cookies because 891.0 - 4.0 = 887.0
Umar bought 887 cookies because 887.0 / 1.0 = 887
#### 887","Step 1: Determine the total money Umar had initially. He spent ₺900 and had 1% left. Let his initial amount be \( M \). Then \( 900 = 0.99M \), so \( M = \frac{900}{0.99} \approx 909.09 \) ₺.  
Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on gum. Each gum costs 80 cents (₺0.80), and he bought 5 bags: \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4 \) ₺.  
Step 3: Subtract the gum cost from the total spent to find the amount spent on cookies: \( 900 - 4 = 896 \) ₺.  
Step 4: Each cookie costs 100 cents (₺1.00). Divide the remaining amount by the cookie price: \( 896 \div 1 = 896 \).
