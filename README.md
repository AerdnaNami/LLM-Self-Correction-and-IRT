## About The Project

This is a course project for the course NLP804 Deep Learning for Natural Language Generation. In this project, I look into 4 prompts for self correction and observe LLM behaviour in the presence or absence of information about an error made in an LLMs solution. Additionally, I apply Item Response Theory to empirically compare proficienct levels to an average 12th grader that took the NAEP exams.
