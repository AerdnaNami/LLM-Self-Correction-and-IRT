3,M180201,Prove that A'C' ≅ D'C' and give a reason for each statement in your proof.,,"The proof aims to demonstrate that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.

    Starting Information (Givens): The proof begins by stating two pieces of given information:
        Point C is the midpoint of the line segment BE.
        Angles B and E are right angles.

    Using the Midpoint Definition: Since C is the midpoint of BE, it divides the segment into two equal parts by definition. Therefore, line segment BC must be congruent to line segment EC.
    Using the Right Angle Information: Since angles B and E are given as right angles, and all right angles are congruent, it follows that angle B is congruent to angle E.
    Identifying Vertical Angles: Angles ACB and DCE are formed by the intersection of line segments AE and BD. These are vertical angles, and vertical angles are always congruent. Thus, angle ACB is congruent to angle DCE.

    Proving Triangle Congruence: Now, comparing triangle ACB and triangle DCE, we have established the following congruencies:
        Angle B ≅ Angle E (Angle)
        Segment BC ≅ Segment EC (Side)
        Angle ACB ≅ Angle DCE (Angle)

        The proof uses these findings to declare that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE. The reason cited is the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate. (Alternatively, since these are right triangles, the Leg-Angle (LA) theorem might be considered, although the established parts fit the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) pattern: ∠B ≅ ∠E, ∠ACB ≅ ∠DCE, and the non-included side BC ≅ EC).

    Final Conclusion (CPCTC): Since it has been established that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE, all their corresponding parts must be congruent. Line segment AC in the first triangle corresponds to line segment DC in the second triangle. Therefore, by the principle that Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent (CPCTC), we can conclude that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.","To prove that \( A'C' \cong D'C' \), we will go through a series of logical steps:

1. **Given Information:**
   - C is the midpoint of \(\overline{BE}\).
   - \(\angle B\) and \(\angle E\) are right angles.

2. **Identify Midpoint Property:**
   - Since C is the midpoint of \(\overline{BE}\), by definition, \(\overline{BC} \cong \overline{CE}\).

3. **Identify Right Angles:**
   - \(\angle B\) and \(\angle E\) being right angles implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEC\) are both right triangles.

4. **Definition of Congruence:**
   - In \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEC\), we have two sides that are equal (\(\overline{BC} \cong \overline{CE}\)) and a right angle each.

5. **Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Theorem:**
   - \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEC\) can be proved congruent by the Hypotenuse-Leg Theorem since they both have one congruent leg (\(\overline{BC} \cong \overline{CE}\)) and a right angle.

6. **Conclude Congruence of Segments:**
   - From the congruence of \(\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEC\), corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent (CPCTC), so \(\overline{A'C'} \cong \overline{D'C'}\).

\(\overline{A'C'} \cong \overline{D'C'}\) by CPCTC from \(\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEC\) due to the HL Theorem.",\(\overline{A'C'} \cong \overline{D'C'}\) by CPCTC from \(\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEC\) due to the HL Theorem.,0
4,M195501,"Quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle O, and is a right angle, as shown above. Segment AB is not parallel to segment DC. Which of the following statements must be true?","A. ∠A≅∠B
B. ∠B≅∠D
C. ∠B is a right angle.
D. AC— is a diameter of circle O.
E. BD— is a diameter of circle O.",E,"To solve this problem, we will analyze each statement given the condition that quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle O and has a right angle.

1. **Understand the Inscribed Quadrilateral:**
   - If a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, its opposite angles are supplementary (sum to 180 degrees).

2. **Identify the Right Angle:**
   - Since the quadrilateral has a right angle, it must mean that one of the angles is 90 degrees. We are given that ∠C is a right angle.

3. **Apply the Property of Inscribed Quadrilaterals:**
   - Opposite angles in an inscribed quadrilateral are supplementary.
   - Since ∠C is 90 degrees, ∠A + ∠C = 180 degrees implies ∠A = 90 degrees.

4. **Assess Each Statement:**

   **A.** ∠A ≅ ∠B:   
   - ∠A is a right angle (90 degrees). For ∠A to be congruent to ∠B, ∠B must also be 90 degrees, which contradicts with ∠B + ∠D = 90 if ∠D is the other right angle. This is generally not true unless otherwise specified, and it doesn't need to be in this geometric setup.

   **B.** ∠B ≅ ∠D:  
   - Both these angles are not specified as equal based on any information provided, and since ∠B + ∠D = 90 degrees, they need not be equal.

   **C.** ∠B is a right angle:  
   - This can only be true if the quadrilateral is a rectangle, which contradicts the description that all four corners aren't necessarily right angles. 

   **D.** AC— is a diameter of circle O:  
   - If AC is a diameter, ∠ABC would be a right angle according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, contradicting the problem setup. This is not confirmed by any provided information.

   **E.** BD— is a diameter of circle O:  
   - If BD is a diameter, and considering ∠B and ∠D, we meet the condition for an inscribed right triangle, fulfilling the requirements of the Inscribed Angle Theorem as ∠C is already a right angle.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Only statement **E** logically aligns with the properties of inscribed quadrilaterals, given ∠C is a right angle and performs the function of the hypotenuse in the circle as per the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

Answer:
E. BD— is a diameter of circle O.",E. BD— is a diameter of circle O.,1

What is the length, in feet, of the side whose dimension is not given in the diagram?","A. 12
B. 24
C. 30
D. 36
E. 40",D,"To find the missing dimension, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Layout**:
   - The diagram is an L-shaped polygon.
   - The layout consists of horizontal and vertical lines.

2. **Identify Total Lengths**:
   - The total top side length is 48 ft.
   - The total right side length is 30 ft + the unknown side.

3. **Calculate the Missing Vertical Length**:
   - Subtract the bottom smaller vertical segment from the top total vertical segment.
   - Total height of the large section (from top to bottom) is 30 ft.
   - Subtract the given segments: \(30 \text{ ft} - 24 \text{ ft} = 6 \text{ ft}\).
   - Therefore, the right side must also account for the missing part: \(24 \text{ ft} + 6 \text{ ft} = 30 \text{ ft}\).

4. **Calculate the Missing Horizontal Length**:
   - The entire base of the L-shape, viewed vertically, is the same 48 ft.
   - The known horizontal segments are 12 ft and 6 ft.
   - Subtract the given from the total: \(48 \text{ ft} - (12 \text{ ft} + 6 \text{ ft}) = 48 \text{ ft} - 18 \text{ ft} = 30 \text{ ft}\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The missing dimension is the horizontal base that completes the total length of the top segment.

6,M191201,"On level ground from a distance of 200 feet, the angle of elevation to the top of a building is 21°, as shown in the figure above. What is the height h of the building, to the nearest foot? ","A. 72
B. 77
C. 187
D. 201
E. 521",B,"To find the height \( h \) of the building, we can use trigonometry. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the Right Triangle:**  
   - We have a right triangle where the base (adjacent side) is 200 feet.
   - The angle of elevation is 21°.
   - The opposite side is the height \( h \) of the building.

2. **Use the Tangent Function:**  
   - The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
   - \(\tan(\text{angle}) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\)
   - In this case: \(\tan(21^\circ) = \frac{h}{200}\)

3. **Solve for \( h \):**  
   - Rearrange the formula to solve for the height \( h \).
   - \( h = 200 \cdot \tan(21^\circ) \)

4. **Calculate \( h \):**  
   - Use a calculator to find \(\tan(21^\circ) \approx 0.38386\).
   - \( h = 200 \cdot 0.38386 \approx 76.772\)

5. **Round to the Nearest Foot:**  
   - \( h \approx 77\) feet.

Thus, the height of the building is approximately 77 feet.
