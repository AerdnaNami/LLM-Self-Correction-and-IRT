0,M184601,Which of the following expressions is NOT equivalent to (a + b)(x + y) ?,"A. (a+b)x+(a+b)y
B. a(x+y)+b(x+y)
C. (b+a)(y+x)
D. ax+by
E. ax+bx+ay+by",D,"To determine which expression is NOT equivalent to \((a + b)(x + y)\), we need to simplify each option and compare it with the original expression.

1. **Simplify \((a + b)(x + y)\):**

   - Use the distributive property: 
   - \((a + b)(x + y) = a(x + y) + b(x + y)\)
   - Distribute each term:
   - \(= ax + ay + bx + by\)

   So, \((a + b)(x + y)\) simplifies to \(ax + ay + bx + by\).

2. **Analyze each choice:**

   **A.** \((a+b)x+(a+b)y\)
   
   - Distribute inside each term: 
   - \(= ax + bx + ay + by\)
   - This simplifies to \(ax + bx + ay + by\), which matches the original expression.

   **B.** \(a(x+y)+b(x+y)\)

   - Already simplified version of the original, as derived in step 1.
   - This simplifies to \(ax + ay + bx + by\), which matches the original expression.

   **C.** \((b+a)(y+x)\)

   - Use the commutative property of addition (order doesn't matter), so this is equivalent to \((a+b)(x+y)\).
   - As derived, this simplifies to \(ax + ay + bx + by\), which matches the original expression.

   **D.** \(ax + by\)

   - This expression is already simplified and has only two terms.
   - It does not match the four-term result \(ax + ay + bx + by\), so it is not equivalent.

   **E.** \(ax + bx + ay + by\)

   - This expression is exactly the simplified form \(ax + ay + bx + by\) of the original.
   - It matches completely with what we derived for \((a+b)(x+y)\).

3. **Identify the expression that is NOT equivalent:**

   - From the analysis above, option D (\(ax + by\)) is the expression that does not match the expanded form of \((a + b)(x + y)\).

B. 38
C. 42
D. 60
E. 65",C,"To solve this problem, we will use trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, because we have a right triangle formed by the ground, the tree, and the line of sight from the cat to the bird’s nest. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.

Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Known Values:**  
   - Distance from the cat to the base of the tree (adjacent side) = 50 feet.
   - Angle of elevation = 40°.

2. **Identify the Unknown:**
   - Height of the bird's nest above the base of the tree (opposite side).

3. **Set Up the Trigonometric Ratio:**
   - Using the tangent function: \(\tan(\text{angle}) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\).
   - Here, \(\tan(40°) = \frac{\text{height of the nest}}{50\ \text{feet}}\).

4. **Calculate \(\tan(40°)\):**
   - Use a calculator to find \(\tan(40°) \approx 0.8391\).

5. **Solve for the Height of the Nest:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for the height:
     \[
     \text{height of the nest} = 50\ \text{feet} \times \tan(40°)

B. $47,250
C. $125,000
D. $220,500
E. $5,250,000",C,"To find the estimated value of the property, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the property tax rate**: The town taxes $42 for each $1,000 of estimated property value. This means the tax rate is $42 per $1,000 of property value.

2. **Determine the property tax owed**: The property owner owes $5,250 in property tax.

3. **Set up the equation to solve for the estimated value of the property**: Let \( V \) represent the estimated value of the property in thousands of dollars. The tax owed can be expressed in terms of the tax rate and \( V \):

   \[
   42 \times V = 5,250
   \]

4. **Solve for \( V \)**: Divide both sides of the equation by 42 to isolate \( V \):

   \[
   V = \frac{5,250}{42}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( V \)**:

   \[
   V = 125

13,M059601,The remainder when a number n is divided by 7 is 2. Which of the following is the remainder when 2n + 1 is divided by 7?,"{'A': '1', 'B': '2', 'C': '3', 'D': '4', 'E': '5'}",E,"To solve the problem, let's use step-by-step reasoning.

1. **Understand the given condition**: When a number \( n \) is divided by 7, it leaves a remainder of 2. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
   \]

2. **Express \( n \) in terms of 7**: Based on the modulo expression, we can write \( n \) as:
   \[
   n = 7k + 2
   \]
   for some integer \( k \).

3. **Formulate the expression for \( 2n + 1 \)**: Substitute the expression for \( n \) into \( 2n + 1 \):

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:** 
   The equation given is \(x^2 + 7x + 6\).

2. **Find the roots of the equation:** 
   To determine where the quadratic is equal to zero, we need the roots of \(x^2 + 7x + 6 = 0\).

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:** 
   \(x^2 + 7x + 6\) factors to \((x + 1)(x + 6)\).

4. **Solve for the roots:** 
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives:
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
   \]
   \[
   x + 6 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -6
   \]
   So, the roots are \(x = -1\) and \(x = -6\).

5. **Determine intervals:** 
   The roots divide the number line into three intervals: 
   \((- \infty, -6)\), \((-6, -1)\), and \((-1, \infty)\).

6. **Test each interval:** 
   
   - For \((- \infty, -6)\), choose \(x = -7\):
     \[
     (-7)^2 + 7(-7) + 6 = 49 - 49 + 6 = 6 \geq 0
     \]
     Hence, in this interval, the quadratic is non-negative.
   
   - For \((-6, -1)\), choose \(x = -3\):
     \[
     (-3)^2 + 7(-3) + 6 = 9 - 21 + 6 = -6 \leq 0
     \]
     Hence, in this interval, the quadratic is negative.
   
   - For \((-1, \infty)\), choose \(x = 0\):
     \[
     0^2 + 7(0) + 6 = 6 \geq 0
     \]
     Hence, in this interval, the quadratic is non-negative.

7. **Conclusion:**
   The quadratic \(x^2 + 7x + 6\) is non-negative in the intervals \((-\infty, -6]\) and \([-1, \infty)\).

8. **Combine the results:**
   The solution to the inequality \(x^2 + 7x + 6 \geq 0\) is:
   \[
   x \leq -6 \quad \text{or} \quad x \geq -1

16,M133101,"Rosa is twice as old as Byron. Fred is one year older than Byron. If Fred's age is represented by F, which of the following represents the ages of Rosa and Byron, respectively?","{'A': '12(F-1) and F-1', 'B': '12(F+1) and F+1', 'C': '2(F-1) and F-1', 'D': '2(F+1) and F+1', 'E': '2F and F-1'}",C,"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Rosa, Byron, and Fred and then match these to the given options.

1. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - We know Rosa is twice as old as Byron.
   - Fred is one year older than Byron.

2. **Express Variables in Terms of Fred's Age (F):**
   - Let's say Byron's age is B.
   - Since Fred is one year older than Byron, we have \( F = B + 1 \).
   - Solving for B in terms of F, we get \( B = F - 1 \).

3. **Express Rosa’s Age:**
   - Rosa's age is twice Byron's age.
   - Rosa's age \( R \) can be expressed as \( R = 2 \times B \).

4. **Substitute Byron’s Expression:**
   - Substitute \( B = F - 1 \) into \( R = 2 \times B \).
   - So, \( R = 2 \times (F - 1) \).
   - This simplifies to \( R = 2(F - 1) \).

5. **Compare with Options:**
   - We need expressions for Rosa and Byron’s ages.
   - Rosa’s age is \( 2(F - 1) \) and Byron’s age is \( F - 1 \).
   - Therefore, the correct representation of their ages is  \( 2(F-1) \) and \( F-1 \).

Matching these with given options:
- Looking at the options, option C: '2(F-1) and F-1' fits perfectly.

17,M130001,A particular flu vaccine is effective for 90 percent of the patients who receive it. What is the probability that it will be effective for both of the next two randomly selected patients?,"{'A': '0.54', 'B': '0.63', 'C': '0.72', 'D': '0.81', 'E': '0.90'}",D,"To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of probability for independent events. Here is the step-by-step chain of thought:

1. **Understanding the Probability of a Single Event:**
   - The probability that the flu vaccine is effective for a single patient is 90%, or 0.90.

2. **Considering Independent Events:**
   - The effectiveness of the vaccine for one patient is independent of its effectiveness for another patient. This means the events are independent.

3. **Calculating the Combined Probability for Two Independent Events:**
   - To find the probability that the vaccine is effective for both of the next two patients, multiply the probability of effectiveness for each patient:
     \[
     P(\text{both effective}) = P(\text{effective for first}) \times P(\text{effective for second})
     \]

4. **Substitute the Known Probability:**
   - Substitute the probability of effectiveness for one patient (0.90) into the expression:
     \[
     P(\text{both effective}) = 0.90 \times 0.90
     \]

5. **Calculate the Probability:**
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     P(\text{both effective}) = 0.81
     \]

6. **Match the Result to Given Options:**
   - Option 'D' is 0.81, which matches our calculated probability.

By following these steps, we see that the correct probability that the vaccine will be effective for both of the next two patients is 0.81.

18,M127901,"An election involving four candidates for mayor has been held. Of the following, which is the best way to present the percentage of votes each candidate received?","{'A': 'Circle graph', 'B': 'Line graph', 'C': 'Box plot', 'D': 'Scatterplot', 'E': 'Histogram'}",A,"To determine the best way to present the percentage of votes each candidate received in an election, let's evaluate each option:

1. **Circle graph (A)**:
   - A circle graph, or pie chart, is designed to show a proportional representation of different categories as parts of a whole. Since we want to show the percentage of votes (which is parts of the total votes), a circle graph would effectively illustrate how each candidate's votes contribute to the total. Each candidate's section of the pie represents their share of the overall votes.

2. **Line graph (B)**:
   - A line graph is typically used to show trends over time. Since we are presenting static data (i.e., the percentages from one election), a line graph would not be appropriate.

3. **Box plot (C)**:
   - A box plot displays the distribution of data based on a five-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum). This doesn't directly apply to showing percentages of votes for categorical data like different candidates in an election.

4. **Scatterplot (D)**:
   - A scatterplot is used to determine the relationship between two variables. It is not suitable for showing categorical data, such as election percentages for each candidate, which are independent rather than variables showing correlation.

5. **Histogram (E)**:
   - A histogram shows the distribution of numerical data and is used to display the frequency of data points within certain ranges. It's not useful for showing percentages of total votes in categorical data.

After evaluating each option, the most suitable way to present the percentage of votes each candidate received is the circle graph (pie chart), because it visually represents the portions of the whole.

19,M135301,"The town of Mayville taxes property at a rate of $42 for each $1,000 of estimated value. What is the estimated value of a property on which the owner owes $5,250 in property tax?","{'A': '$42,000', 'B': '$47,250', 'C': '$125,000', 'D': '$220,500', 'E': '$5,250,000'}",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the estimated value of a property based on the property tax owed, given the tax rate. We'll do this step-by-step using the given information.

1. **Identify the tax rate and the amount of tax owed.**
   - The tax rate is $42 for each $1,000 of estimated value.
   - The total tax owed is $5,250.

2. **Express the tax rate as a ratio or fraction.**
   - The tax rate can be expressed as $42 per $1,000, which is equivalent to a fraction: \(\frac{42}{1000}\).

3. **Set up an equation to relate tax rate and property value.**
   - Let the estimated property value be \( V \) (in dollars). The tax owed can be calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{42}{1000} \times V = 5250
     \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( V \).**
   - First, clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 1000:
     \[
     42 \times V = 5250 \times 1000
     \]
   - Then, simplify the right side:
     \[
     42 \times V = 5250000
     \]
   - Finally, solve for \( V \) by dividing both sides by 42:
     \[
     V = \frac{5250000}{42}
     \]

5. **Calculate the value.**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     V = 125000
     \]

6. **Verify the computation and match the answer to a choice.**
   - Therefore, the estimated value of the property is $125,000. This corresponds to choice C.

Answer: C: $125,000","C: $125,000",1
20,M127001,The number of bacteria present in a laboratory sample after t days can be represented by 500(2t). What is the initial number of bacteria present in this sample?,"{'A': '250', 'B': '500', 'C': '750', 'D': '1,000', 'E': '2,000'}",B,"To determine the initial number of bacteria present in the laboratory sample, we need to evaluate the expression for the number of bacteria when \( t = 0 \).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the expression:** The number of bacteria is given by the expression \( 500(2^t) \).

2. **Determine the initial condition:** The initial number of bacteria means the number present when time \( t = 0 \).

3. **Substitute \( t = 0 \) into the expression:** 
   \[
   500(2^t) \quad \text{becomes} \quad 500(2^0)

21,M135401,"A cat lies crouched on level ground 50 feet away from the base of a tree. The cat can see a bird's nest directly above the base of the tree. The angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest is 40°. To the nearest foot, how far above the base of the tree is the bird's nest?","{'A': '32', 'B': '38', 'C': '42', 'D': '60', 'E': '65'}",C,"To find out how far above the base of the tree the bird's nest is, we can solve this problem using trigonometry, specifically by using the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to the opposite and adjacent sides of a right triangle.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Right Triangle:**
   - The distance from the cat to the base of the tree (horizontal distance) is the adjacent side of the triangle.
   - The height from the base of the tree to the bird's nest is the opposite side of the triangle.
   - The angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest is 40°.

2. **Identify Known Values:**
   - Adjacent side (distance on the ground): 50 feet
   - Angle of elevation: 40°

3. **Set Up the Tangent Function:**
   - The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
   - \(\tan (\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjacent side}}\)

4. **Insert Known Values into the Tangent Function:**
   - \(\tan (40°) = \frac{\text{height}}{50}\)

5. **Solve for the Height (opposite side):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate the height:
   - \(\text{height} = 50 \times \tan (40°)\)

6. **Calculate the Tangent of 40°:**
   - Use a calculator to find \(\tan (40°) \approx 0.8391\)

7. **Plug in the Tangent Value and Calculate the Height:**
   - \(\text{height} = 50 \times 0.8391 = 41.955\)

8. **Round to the Nearest Foot:**
   - Rounding 41.955 to the nearest whole number gives us 42.

So, to the nearest foot, the bird's nest is 42 feet above the base of the tree.

Let C represent the cost of a ticket in dollars and y represent the number of years in the future. Her model is as follows.C=2.50y+13Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","{'A': '$5', 'B': '$8', 'C': '$13', 'D': '$18', 'E': '$26'}",A,"To determine how much the cost of a ticket will increase in two years using Yvonne's model \( C = 2.50y + 13 \), we need to calculate the change in the cost when \( y \) increases from 0 to 2.

1. **Identify the model**: The cost of a ticket is given by the equation \( C = 2.50y + 13 \).

2. **Determine the initial cost**: 
   - When \( y = 0 \), \( C = 2.50(0) + 13 = 13 \).

3. **Calculate the cost in two years**:
   - When \( y = 2 \), substitute 2 into the equation:
   \[
   C = 2.50(2) + 13 = 5 + 13 = 18
