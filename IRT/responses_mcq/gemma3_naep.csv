0,M184601,Which of the following expressions is NOT equivalent to (a + b)(x + y) ?,"A. (a+b)x+(a+b)y
B. a(x+y)+b(x+y)
C. (b+a)(y+x)
D. ax+by
E. ax+bx+ay+by",D,"Here's how we can solve this problem using a chain of thought:

1. **Expand the original expression:** Let's start by expanding (a + b)(x + y) using the distributive property (often remembered as FOIL - First, Outer, Inner, Last).
   (a + b)(x + y) = a(x + y) + b(x + y) = ax + ay + bx + by

2. **Analyze option A:** (a+b)x+(a+b)y.  Using the distributive property again, this becomes ax + bx + ay + by. This is the same as the expanded form of the original expression. Thus, A *is* equivalent.

3. **Analyze option B:** a(x+y)+b(x+y). This is exactly the same step we did when first expanding (a+b)(x+y), namely distributing (a+b) across (x+y). So, this expression simplifies to ax + ay + bx + by, matching our expanded result. Thus, B *is* equivalent.

4. **Analyze option C:** (b+a)(y+x).  The order of terms within the parentheses does not matter due to the commutative properties of addition (a+b = b+a and x+y = y+x). So, (b+a)(y+x) = (a+b)(x+y), meaning it will also expand to ax + ay + bx + by. Thus, C *is* equivalent.

5. **Analyze option D:** ax+by. This expression only includes products of 'a' with 'x' and 'b' with 'y'. It's missing the 'ay' and 'bx' terms that were generated during the initial expansion. Therefore, D is *not* equivalent.

6. **Analyze option E:** ax+bx+ay+by. This is directly equal to what we got when we expanded the original expression (ax + ay + bx + by). Thus, E *is* equivalent.

7. **Identify the non-equivalent expression:** Comparing all of our analysis, only option D, ax + by, does not match the expanded form of the original expression.

Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","A. $5
B. $8
C. $13
D. $18
E. $26",A,"Here's how to solve this problem using a chain of thought:

1. **Understand the Model:** The equation C = 2.50y + 13 represents the predicted cost (C) of a ticket after y years. The '2.50' is the rate of increase in cost per year, and '13' is the initial cost.

2. **Calculate the Cost After Two Years:** To find the cost of the ticket in two years, substitute y = 2 into the equation:
   C = 2.50(2) + 13
   C = 5 + 13
   C = 18

3. **Calculate the Current Cost**: To find the current cost, substitute y = 0 into the equation.
   C = 2.50(0) + 13
   C = 0 + 13
   C = 13

4. **Calculate the Increase in Cost**: To determine the increase in cost over two years, subtract the current cost from the cost in two years:
   Increase = Cost in two years - Current Cost
   Increase = $18 - $13
   Increase = $5

6,M180201,Prove that A'C' ≅ D'C' and give a reason for each statement in your proof.,,"The proof aims to demonstrate that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.

    Starting Information (Givens): The proof begins by stating two pieces of given information:
        Point C is the midpoint of the line segment BE.
        Angles B and E are right angles.

    Using the Midpoint Definition: Since C is the midpoint of BE, it divides the segment into two equal parts by definition. Therefore, line segment BC must be congruent to line segment EC.
    Using the Right Angle Information: Since angles B and E are given as right angles, and all right angles are congruent, it follows that angle B is congruent to angle E.
    Identifying Vertical Angles: Angles ACB and DCE are formed by the intersection of line segments AE and BD. These are vertical angles, and vertical angles are always congruent. Thus, angle ACB is congruent to angle DCE.

    Proving Triangle Congruence: Now, comparing triangle ACB and triangle DCE, we have established the following congruencies:
        Angle B ≅ Angle E (Angle)
        Segment BC ≅ Segment EC (Side)
        Angle ACB ≅ Angle DCE (Angle)

        The proof uses these findings to declare that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE. The reason cited is the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate. (Alternatively, since these are right triangles, the Leg-Angle (LA) theorem might be considered, although the established parts fit the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) pattern: ∠B ≅ ∠E, ∠ACB ≅ ∠DCE, and the non-included side BC ≅ EC).

    Final Conclusion (CPCTC): Since it has been established that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE, all their corresponding parts must be congruent. Line segment AC in the first triangle corresponds to line segment DC in the second triangle. Therefore, by the principle that Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent (CPCTC), we can conclude that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.","Here's a step-by-step proof to show that A'C' ≅ D'C', utilizing the information from the image and given statements:

1.  **Statement:** C is the midpoint of BE.
    **Reason:** Given.

2.  **Statement:** BC ≅ CE
    **Reason:** Definition of Midpoint - A midpoint divides a segment into two congruent segments.

3.  **Statement:** ∠B ≅ ∠E

B. ∠B≅∠D
C. ∠B is a right angle.
D. AC— is a diameter of circle O.
E. BD— is a diameter of circle O.",E,"Here's a breakdown of the solution using chain of thought:

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords in a circle that have a common endpoint. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Given Information:** We know that quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle O, meaning all its vertices lie on the circle. We are also told that ∠C is a right angle (90 degrees).

3. **Intercepted Arc and Angle C:** Since ∠C is a right angle, it intercepts arc ADB.  Because ∠C = 90°, the measure of arc ADB must be 2 * 90° = 180°.

4. **Diameter and 180° Arcs:**  An arc with a measure of 180° is a semicircle. A semicircle corresponds to a diameter of the circle. Therefore, segment ADB is a diameter of circle O.

5. **Angle in a Semicircle:** An angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle. Since ADB is a diameter, any angle inscribed that intercepts the arc ADB is a right angle.

6. **Checking the answer choices:**
   * A. ∠A≅∠B: We don't know anything about angles A and B being equal, and AB is explicitly *not* parallel to DC.
   * B. ∠B≅∠D:  Similarly, we have no information to support these two angles being congruent.
   * C. ∠B is a right angle: This is possible, but *not* necessarily true.
   * D. AC— is a diameter of circle O:  We determined that ADB is a diameter, not AC.
   * E. BD— is a diameter of circle O: Since ADB is a diameter, BD must be part of this diameter. 

7. **Final Determination:** Because ∠C is a right angle, and since any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle, this means that segment ADB is a diameter. Since ADB is a diameter, it must be true that AC is a diameter of circle O.&#x20;

8,M071501,"The diagram is part of a scale drawing of a house.
What is the length, in feet, of the side whose dimension is not given in the diagram?","A. 12
B. 24
C. 30
D. 36
E. 40",D,"Here's how we can solve this problem using a chain of thought:

1. **Identify the shape:** The diagram shows a composite shape that can be broken down into two rectangles.
2. **Analyze the given information:** We have dimensions for parts of the shape: a length of 48ft, a width of 24ft, a length of 30ft, a width of 6ft, and a length of 12ft.
3. **Recognize similar rectangles:** The two rectangles share a common side. We can compare the ratios of sides of the rectangles to determine the length of missing side.
4. **Set up a proportion:** The shorter rectangle has sides of 6ft and 12ft. The larger rectangle has a side of 24ft. Since 24ft = 4 * 6ft, the corresponding side of the larger rectangle should be 4 * 12ft.
5. **Calculate the missing side:** 4 * 12ft = 48ft. However, we already have one side with the length of 48ft. So, we should consider the rectangle with 30ft and unknown side.
6. **Set up another proportion:** Considering the similarity between rectangles, the ratio of sides 6:12 is the same as 24:x, where x is the missing side. As we know the longer side is 48ft, we can say the opposite side corresponds to 30ft. 6:30 is equal to 12:x. Solve for x: 6x = 30 * 12, x = 30 * 2= 60, but we are given 48ft as one of the side lengths.
7. **Consider the total length:** We have the length of the top side is 48ft, if we subtract 6ft from it, then the remaining length must be equal to 12ft. This does not seem right. Notice that the sides are forming a right angle.
8. **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:** Let's denote the unknown length as *x*. We can form a right triangle with the lengths *x*, 24 ft and 30 ft. Then *x*<sup>2</sup> + 24<sup>2</sup> = 30<sup>2</sup>.  *x*<sup>2</sup> = 30<sup>2</sup> - 24<sup>2</sup> = 900 - 576 = 324. *x* = √324 = 18ft.
9. **Consider a different approach:** If we examine the given lengths, we might notice the scale is based on multiples of 6. 48 is 8*6, 24 is 4*6, 30 is 5*6, and 12 is 2*6. The missing side should also be a multiple of 6. The answer choices suggest the missing side is 12, 24, 30, 36, or 40. Since 12 is 2*6, 24 is 4*6, 30 is 5*6, 36 is 6*6, and 40 is not a multiple of 6. Checking the answer choices; 12ft, 24ft, and 30ft are given. The other side is unknown, so the answer must be 36ft.

Another way to look at this problem could be to consider that 12+x is one side, whose dimension is not given. Then the other side is 24ft. The perimeter of the side is 48ft+30ft+24ft+12ft+x = x + 114ft. The rectangle dimensions suggest we have similar figures, so we can assert that 30/24=12/x where 30 ft and 24 ft are proportional to 12 ft and x ft respectively. Then 30x = 24*12 and x = 288/30 = 9.6. However, this doesn't align with the choices given.

If we assume that the length of the missing side is x, and we can form two rectangles, then, we can observe that the sides from the corners are aligned and correspond to right angles. Then we can observe a parallel and perpendicular relationship and divide the total shape into smaller parts.

Looking at the images, we can observe the sides are 48 and 30 which are on opposite sides. Given the two rectangles, then the missing side should be 36 ft.

E. 521",B,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have a right triangle where we know the angle of elevation (21°) and the adjacent side (200 feet). We want to find the opposite side (the height 'h' of the building).  The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite and adjacent sides is the tangent (tan).

2. **Write the equation:**  tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent.  So, tan(21°) = h / 200.

3. **Solve for h:**  Multiply both sides of the equation by 200 to isolate h:  h = 200 * tan(21°).

C. $125,000
D. $220,500
E. $5,250,000",C,"Here's how to solve this problem using a chain of thought:

1. **Understand the tax rate:** The tax rate is $42 per $1,000 of estimated value. This means for every $1,000 of value, $42 in tax is owed.

2. **Determine the number of $1,000 units:** We need to find out how many ""$1,000"" units are represented by the total tax owed ($5,250). To do this, divide the total tax by the tax per $1,000:  $5,250 / $42 = 125

3. **Calculate the estimated value:** Since each '$1,000' unit represents $1,000 of the property's estimated value, multiply the number of units (125) by $1,000: 125 * $1,000 = $125,000

4. **Check the answer:** Does this make sense? If the property is valued at $125,000, and the tax is $42 per $1,000, then the tax owed is ($125,000/$1,000) * $42 = 125 * $42 = $5,250. This matches the given information.
