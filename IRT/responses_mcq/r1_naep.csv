1,M130101,"Yvonne has studied the cost of tickets over time for her favorite sports team. She has created a model to predict the cost of a ticket in the future. Let C represent the cost of a ticket in dollars and y represent the number of years in the future. Her model is as follows.
C=2.50y+13
Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","A. $5
B. $8
C. $13
D. $18
E. $26",A,"Answer: A

1. Understand that the model C = 2.50y + 13 predicts ticket cost, with y as years into the future.
2. The current cost (y = 0) is calculated as C = 2.50(0) + 13 = $13.
3. For two years in the future (y = 2), substitute into the model: C = 2.50(2) + 13 = 5 + 13 = $18.
4. Determine the increase in cost by subtracting the current cost from the future cost: $18 - $13 = $5.
5. Verify the rate of increase: The slope (2.50) represents annual increase. Over two years, 2.50 * 2 = $5.
6. Confirm the answer matches option A.

6,M180201,Prove that A'C' ≅ D'C' and give a reason for each statement in your proof.,,"The proof aims to demonstrate that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.

    Starting Information (Givens): The proof begins by stating two pieces of given information:
        Point C is the midpoint of the line segment BE.
        Angles B and E are right angles.

    Using the Midpoint Definition: Since C is the midpoint of BE, it divides the segment into two equal parts by definition. Therefore, line segment BC must be congruent to line segment EC.
    Using the Right Angle Information: Since angles B and E are given as right angles, and all right angles are congruent, it follows that angle B is congruent to angle E.
    Identifying Vertical Angles: Angles ACB and DCE are formed by the intersection of line segments AE and BD. These are vertical angles, and vertical angles are always congruent. Thus, angle ACB is congruent to angle DCE.

    Proving Triangle Congruence: Now, comparing triangle ACB and triangle DCE, we have established the following congruencies:
        Angle B ≅ Angle E (Angle)
        Segment BC ≅ Segment EC (Side)
        Angle ACB ≅ Angle DCE (Angle)

        The proof uses these findings to declare that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE. The reason cited is the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate. (Alternatively, since these are right triangles, the Leg-Angle (LA) theorem might be considered, although the established parts fit the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) pattern: ∠B ≅ ∠E, ∠ACB ≅ ∠DCE, and the non-included side BC ≅ EC).

    Final Conclusion (CPCTC): Since it has been established that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE, all their corresponding parts must be congruent. Line segment AC in the first triangle corresponds to line segment DC in the second triangle. Therefore, by the principle that Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent (CPCTC), we can conclude that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.","1. **Identify congruent triangles**: Triangles ABC and DBC are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side).  
   - **Reason**: AB ≅ DB (given), BC ≅ BC (reflexive property), and ∠ABC ≅ ∠DBC (given).  

2. **Corresponding parts**: AC ≅ DC.

3. **Apply transformation**: A reflection/rotation preserves segment lengths.  
   - **Reason**: Rigid transformations maintain congruence.  

4. **Image segments**: A'C' ≅ AC and D'C' ≅ DC.

7,M195501,"Quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle O, and is a right angle, as shown above. Segment AB is not parallel to segment DC. Which of the following statements must be true?","A. ∠A≅∠B
B. ∠B≅∠D
C. ∠B is a right angle.
D. AC— is a diameter of circle O.
E. BD— is a diameter of circle O.",E,"1. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties**: Since ABCD is inscribed in a circle, it is a cyclic quadrilateral. In cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary (sum to 180°).  
2. **Angle A Analysis**: ∠A is a right angle (90°). By the cyclic quadrilateral property, its opposite angle ∠C must also be 90° (since 90° + ∠C = 180° ⇒ ∠C = 90°). However, the answer choices do not involve ∠C.  
3. **Option A (∠A ≅ ∠B)**: ∠A = 90°, but ∠B cannot be 90° because ∠B and ∠D must sum to 180° (cyclic quadrilateral property). If ∠B were 90°, ∠D would also be 90°, making ABCD a rectangle with AB ∥ DC, which contradicts the given that AB is not parallel to DC. Thus, ∠A ≅ ∠B is false.  
4. **Option B (∠B ≅ ∠D)**: For ∠B ≅ ∠D, both angles would need to be 90° (since ∠B + ∠D = 180°). This again implies AB ∥ DC, which is false. Hence, ∠B ≅ ∠D is false.  
5. **Option C (∠B is a right angle)**: As explained above, ∠B = 90° would force ABCD into a rectangle, contradicting AB ∥ DC. Thus, ∠B is not a right angle.  
6. **Option D (AC is a diameter)**: For AC to be a diameter, an angle subtended by AC (e.g., ∠B or ∠D) must be 90°. However, neither ∠B nor ∠D is guaranteed to be 90°, so AC is not necessarily a diameter.  
7. **Option E (BD is a diameter)**: ∠A = 90° subtends arc BD. By Thales’ theorem, an inscribed right angle subtends a semicircle (180° arc), so BD must be the diameter. This is always true.
