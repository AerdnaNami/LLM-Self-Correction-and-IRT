B. a(x+y)+b(x+y)
C. (b+a)(y+x)
D. ax+by
E. ax+bx+ay+by",D,"To determine which expression is NOT equivalent to \( (a + b)(x + y) \), we need to expand each expression and compare it to the expanded form of \( (a + b)(x + y) \). Let's expand \( (a + b)(x + y) \) first:

Step 1: Expand \( (a + b)(x + y) \)
Using the distributive property, we get:
\[ (a + b)(x + y) = ax + ay + bx + by \]

Step 2: Compare each option to the expanded form \( ax + ay + bx + by \)

A. \( (a + b)x + (a + b)y \)
Expanding this:
\[ (a + b)x + (a + b)y = ax + bx + ay + by \]
This is equivalent to \( ax + ay + bx + by \).

B. \( a(x + y) + b(x + y) \)
Expanding this using the distributive property:
\[ a(x + y) + b(x + y) = ax + ay + bx + by \]
This is equivalent to \( ax + ay + bx + by \).

C. \( (b + a)(y + x) \)
Expanding this:
\[ (b + a)(y + x) = by + bx + ay + ax \]
Since multiplication is commutative (\( a + b \) is the same as \( b + a \) and \( x + y \) is the same as \( y + x \)), this simplifies to:
\[ by + bx + ay + ax = ax + ay + bx + by \]
This is equivalent to \( ax + ay + bx + by \).

D. \( ax + by \)
This is simply the sum of \( ax \) and \( by \). It does not include \( bx \) and \( ay \) as required by the original expression, making it NOT equivalent to \( ax + ay + bx + by \).

E. \( ax + bx + ay + by \)
This is already in the expanded form and is equivalent to \( ax + ay + bx + by \).

Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","A. $5
B. $8
C. $13
D. $18
E. $26",A,"To determine how much the cost of a ticket will increase in two years, we need to use Yvonne's model equation \( C = 2.50y + 13 \). Here's the chain of thought step-by-step:

1. **Identify the variables and the model:**
   - \( C \) represents the cost of a ticket in dollars.
   - \( y \) represents the number of years in the future.

2. **Substitute the number of years into the equation:**
   - We need to find the increase in ticket cost after 2 years, which means \( y = 2 \).
   - Substitute \( y = 2 \) into the equation \( C = 2.50y + 13 \).

3. **Perform the calculation:**
   \[
   C = 2.50 \times 2 + 13
   \]
   \[
   C = 5 + 13
   \]
   \[
   C = 18
   \]

4. **Interpret the result:**
   - The cost of the ticket in two years will be $18.
   - Since the base cost (without years) is $13, the increase in cost is:
   \[
   18 - 13 = 5

2,M190101,"The first four terms in a sequence are shown below.
40,8,24,16,⋯
Each term after the first two terms is found by taking one-half the sum of the two preceding terms. Which term is the first odd number in this sequence?","A. The 5th term
B. The 6th term
C. The 7th term
D. The 8th term
E. The 9th term",C,"To determine which term is the first odd number in the sequence, we need to understand the pattern and continue generating the sequence step by step.

### Step 1: Define the Sequence Rule
The sequence starts with:
\[ a_1 = 40, \quad a_2 = 8 \]

Each term after the first two is found by taking one-half the sum of the two preceding terms:
\[ a_n = \frac{1}{2} (a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}) \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Next Terms
Let's calculate the next terms using the rule:

- \( a_3 = \frac{1}{2} (a_2 + a_1) = \frac{1}{2} (8 + 40) = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \)
- \( a_4 = \frac{1}{2} (a_3 + a_2) = \frac{1}{2} (24 + 8) = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \)
- \( a_5 = \frac{1}{2} (a_4 + a_3) = \frac{1}{2} (16 + 24) = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \)
- \( a_6 = \frac{1}{2} (a_5 + a_4) = \frac{1}{2} (20 + 16) = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \)
- \( a_7 = \frac{1}{2} (a_6 + a_5) = \frac{1}{2} (18 + 20) = \frac{1}{2} \times 38 = 19 \)
- \( a_8 = \frac{1}{2} (a_7 + a_6) = \frac{1}{2} (19 + 18) = \frac{1}{2} \times 37 = 18.5 \)
- \( a_9 = \frac{1}{2} (a_8 + a_7) = \frac{1}{2} (18.5 + 19) = \frac{1}{2} \times 37.5 = 18.75 \)

### Step 3: Identify the First Odd Number
From the calculations:
\[ a_1 = 40, \quad a_2 = 8, \quad a_3 = 24, \quad a_4 = 16, \quad a_5 = 20, \quad a_6 = 18, \quad a_7 = 19 \]

The first odd number in the sequence is \( a_7 = 19 \).

### Step 1: Understand the Tax Rate
The tax rate is $42 for every $1,000 of the estimated property value.

### Step 2: Set Up the Proportion
Given that $42 is the tax for $1,000 of value, we need to find the value (V) that corresponds to $5,250 in tax.

The proportion can be written as:
\[ \frac{42}{1000} = \frac{5250}{V} \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( V \)
To find \( V \), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:
\[ 42V = 5250 \times 1000 \]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation

9,M094801,"In a school fund-raiser, 10 students in class A sold an average (arithmetic mean) of 4 boxes of cookies. In class B, 15 students sold an average of 9 boxes. What was the average number of boxes of cookies sold by the 25 students?","{'A': '1325', 'B': '1', 'C': '612', 'D': '7', 'E': '13613'}",D,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Boxes Sold by Each Class

First, we need to find the total number of boxes sold by each class.

- **Class A:**
  - Number of students: 10
  - Average boxes sold per student: 4
  - Total boxes sold by Class A = Number of students × Average boxes per student
  \[
  \text{Total boxes sold by Class A} = 10 \times 4 = 40
  \]

- **Class B:**
  - Number of students: 15
  - Average boxes sold per student: 9
  - Total boxes sold by Class B = Number of students × Average boxes per student
  \[
  \text{Total boxes sold by Class B} = 15 \times 9 = 135
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Boxes Sold by All Students

Next, we add the total boxes sold by both classes to get the overall total.

\[
\text{Total boxes sold by all students} = \text{Total boxes sold by Class A} + \text{Total boxes sold by Class B}
\]
\[
\text{Total boxes sold by all students} = 40 + 135 = 175
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Average Number of Boxes Sold per Student

Finally, we find the average number of boxes sold by dividing the total number of boxes sold by the total number of students.

- Total number of students: 10 (Class A) + 15 (Class B) = 25
- Average number of boxes sold per student
\[
\text{Average number of boxes sold per student} = \frac{\text{Total boxes sold by all students}}{\text{Total number of students}}
\]
\[
\text{Average number of boxes sold per student} = \frac{175}{25} = 7

1. We are given that when a number \( n \) is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
   \]

2. We need to find the remainder when \( 2n + 1 \) is divided by 7. We can use the given information to express \( 2n + 1 \) in terms of \( n \).

3. Since \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we substitute \( n \) with 2 in the expression \( 2n + 1 \):

14,M019401,What are all values of x such that x2+7x+6≥0 ?,"{'A': '-6≤x≤-1', 'B': '-6≤x≤1', 'C': '1≤x≤6', 'D': 'x≤-6 or x≥-1', 'E': 'x≤1 or x≥6'}",D,"To solve the inequality \(x^2 + 7x + 6 \geq 0\), we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Factor the quadratic expression.
The quadratic expression \(x^2 + 7x + 6\) can be factored into \((x + 6)(x + 1)\). So we rewrite the inequality as:
\[
(x + 6)(x + 1) \geq 0
\]

Step 2: Find the critical points.
The critical points are the values of \(x\) that make the factored expression equal to zero. These are the solutions to the equations \(x + 6 = 0\) and \(x + 1 = 0\).
\[
x + 6 = 0 \implies x = -6
\]
\[
x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1
\]
So, the critical points are \(x = -6\) and \(x = -1\).

Step 3: Determine the intervals to test.
The critical points divide the number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -6)\), \((-6, -1)\), and \((-1, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

Step 4: Test the intervals.
- For the interval \((-\infty, -6)\), choose \(x = -7\):
\[
(x + 6)(x + 1) = (-7 + 6)(-7 + 1) = (-1)(-6) = 6 \geq 0
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-\infty, -6)\).

- For the interval \((-6, -1)\), choose \(x = -4\):
\[
(x + 6)(x + 1) = (-4 + 6)(-4 + 1) = (2)(-3) = -6 \not\geq 0
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-6, -1)\).

- For the interval \((-1, \infty)\), choose \(x = 0\):
\[
(x + 6)(x + 1) = (0 + 6)(0 + 1) = 6 \geq 0
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-1, \infty)\).

Step 5: Check the critical points.
We need to check if the inequality holds at the critical points \(x = -6\) and \(x = -1\):
\[
(-6 + 6)(-6 + 1) = 0 \geq 0
\]
\[
(-1 + 6)(-1 + 1) = 0 \geq 0
\]
So, the inequality holds at \(x = -6\) and \(x = -1\).

Combining all the information, the inequality \(x^2 + 7x + 6 \geq 0\) holds in the intervals \((-\infty, -6]\) and \([-1, \infty)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
x \leq -6 \text{ or } x \geq -1

17,M130001,A particular flu vaccine is effective for 90 percent of the patients who receive it. What is the probability that it will be effective for both of the next two randomly selected patients?,"{'A': '0.54', 'B': '0.63', 'C': '0.72', 'D': '0.81', 'E': '0.90'}",D,"Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Given Information:**
   - The flu vaccine is effective for 90 percent of the patients.
   - We need to find the probability that it will be effective for both of the next two randomly selected patients.

2. **Convert Percentage to Decimal:**
   - The probability of the vaccine being effective is 90 percent, which can be converted to a decimal as 0.90.

3. **Determine Independence:**
   - The effectiveness of the vaccine in one patient is independent of the effectiveness in another patient. This means the outcome for one patient does not affect the outcome for another.

4. **Calculate Combined Probability:**
   - To find the probability of both events happening (the vaccine being effective for both patients), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event.
   - Probability of the vaccine being effective for the first patient = 0.90
   - Probability of the vaccine being effective for the second patient = 0.90

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Combined probability = 0.90 * 0.90 = 0.81

Answer: The probability that the flu vaccine will be effective for both of the next two randomly selected patients is 0.81.

Final Answer: D",The probability that the flu vaccine will be effective for both of the next two randomly selected patients is 0.81.
18,M127901,"An election involving four candidates for mayor has been held. Of the following, which is the best way to present the percentage of votes each candidate received?","{'A': 'Circle graph', 'B': 'Line graph', 'C': 'Box plot', 'D': 'Scatterplot', 'E': 'Histogram'}",A,"To determine the best way to present the percentage of votes each candidate received for an election involving four candidates, we need to consider the nature of the data and the information we want to convey.

### Step 1: Understanding the Data
- We have four candidates.
- We need to display the percentage of votes each candidate received.
- The percentages will sum up to 100%.

### Step 2: Evaluating the Options
- **Circle graph (Pie chart)**: This is ideal for showing the proportion of each category in a total. It visually represents the percentage of the whole, making it easy to compare the relative大小s of different categories.
- **Line graph**: This is used to show trends over time or continuous data, which is not relevant here.
- **Box plot**: This is used to show the distribution of data with quartiles and the median, which is not appropriate for displaying percentages.
- **Scatterplot**: This is used to show the relationship between two numerical variables, which is not the case here.
- **Histogram**: This is used to show the distribution of a single numerical variable, typically in intervals or bins, which is not suitable for percentages.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Given that we need to show the proportion of votes each candidate received, a circle graph (pie chart) is the best choice. It will clearly display each candidate's percentage and allow for easy comparison.

19,M135301,"The town of Mayville taxes property at a rate of $42 for each $1,000 of estimated value. What is the estimated value of a property on which the owner owes $5,250 in property tax?","{'A': '$42,000', 'B': '$47,250', 'C': '$125,000', 'D': '$220,500', 'E': '$5,250,000'}",C,"To determine the estimated value of a property with an owed tax of $5,250, we can use the given tax rate of $42 for every $1,000 of estimated value. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Tax Rate**: The tax rate is $42 for every $1,000 of property value.

2. **Set Up the Proportional Relationship**: The tax owed is directly proportional to the value of the property. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find the total tax (T) for a given value (V).

\[ \frac{42}{1000} = \frac{5250}{V} \]

3. **Solve for V**:
   
   Multiply both sides of the equation to eliminate the fractions:

   \[ 42V = 5250 \times 1000 \]

   Simplify the right-hand side:

   \[ 42V = 5250000 \]

   Divide both sides by 42 to isolate V:

   \[ V = \frac{5250000}{42} \]

   Calculate this:

   \[ V \approx 125000 \]

   So, the estimated value of the property led to this tax amount.

Answer:
C: $125,000","C: $125,000"
20,M127001,The number of bacteria present in a laboratory sample after t days can be represented by 500(2t). What is the initial number of bacteria present in this sample?,"{'A': '250', 'B': '500', 'C': '750', 'D': '1,000', 'E': '2,000'}",B,"Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The formula given for the number of bacteria present after t days is N(t) = 500(2^t).

2) The question asks for the initial number of bacteria present. The initial number corresponds to t = 0 because at t = 0, we are looking at the start or beginning.

3) To find the initial number of bacteria, we need to substitute t = 0 into the formula:
   N(0) = 500(2^0)

4) We know that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore:
   2^0 = 1

5) Substituting this back into our formula gives:
   N(0) = 500(1) = 500

6) So, the initial number of bacteria present in the sample is 500.

21,M135401,"A cat lies crouched on level ground 50 feet away from the base of a tree. The cat can see a bird's nest directly above the base of the tree. The angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest is 40°. To the nearest foot, how far above the base of the tree is the bird's nest?","{'A': '32', 'B': '38', 'C': '42', 'D': '60', 'E': '65'}",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to the height of the bird's nest. Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the given information
- Distance from the cat to the base of the tree: 50 feet
- Angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest: 40°

Step 2: Draw a right triangle to represent the situation
- The horizontal leg is the distance from the cat to the base of the tree (50 feet).
- The vertical leg is the height of the bird's nest above the base of the tree, which we need to find.
- The angle of elevation is the angle between the horizontal leg and the line of sight to the bird's nest.

Step 3: Use the tangent function
- The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side (vertical leg) to the length of the adjacent side (horizontal leg).
- In this case, tan(40°) = height / 50

Step 4: Solve for the height
- height = 50 * tan(40°)
- Using a calculator, tan(40°) ≈ 0.839
- height ≈ 50 * 0.839
- height ≈ 41.95 feet

Step 5: Round to the nearest foot
- Since the question asks for the height to the nearest foot, we round 41.95 to 42 feet.

22,M130101,"Yvonne has studied the cost of tickets over time for her favorite sports team. She has created a model to predict the cost of a ticket in the future. Let C represent the cost of a ticket in dollars and y represent the number of years in the future. Her model is as follows.C=2.50y+13Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","{'A': '$5', 'B': '$8', 'C': '$13', 'D': '$18', 'E': '$26'}",A,"To find out how much the cost of a ticket will increase in two years based on Yvonne's model, let's follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the model given
The model is C = 2.50y + 13, where C is the cost of a ticket in dollars and y is the number of years in the future.

Step 2: Determine the cost of a ticket in two years
Plugging in y = 2 (since we're looking for the cost in two years):
C = 2.50 * 2 + 13
C = 5 + 13
C = $18

Step 3: Calculate the increase from the current cost
To calculate the increase, we need to know the current cost (which we can find by setting y = 0 in the model):
C = 2.50 * 0 + 13
C = $13

Step 4: Subtract the current cost from the future cost
Increase in cost = Future cost - Current cost
Increase in cost = $18 - $13
Increase in cost = $5

Therefore, the cost of a ticket will increase by $5 in two years.

Answer:
A: $5",A: $5
