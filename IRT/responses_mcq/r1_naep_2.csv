0,M184601,Which of the following expressions is NOT equivalent to (a + b)(x + y) ?,"A. (a+b)x+(a+b)y
B. a(x+y)+b(x+y)
C. (b+a)(y+x)
D. ax+by
E. ax+bx+ay+by",D,"Answer: D

Step 1: Expand the original expression \((a + b)(x + y)\) using the distributive property:
\[
(a + b)(x + y) = a(x) + a(y) + b(x) + b(y) = ax + ay + bx + by.
\]

Step 2: Analyze each option:
- **A**: \((a+b)x + (a+b)y = ax + bx + ay + by\) (matches original expansion).
- **B**: \(a(x+y) + b(x+y) = ax + ay + bx + by\) (matches original expansion).
- **C**: \((b+a)(y+x)\) is equivalent to \((a+b)(x+y)\) due to commutative property (matches original).
- **D**: \(ax + by\) lacks the terms \(ay\) and \(bx\) (does not match original expansion).
- **E**: \(ax + bx + ay + by\) rearranges to \(ax + ay + bx + by\) (matches original expansion).

Step 3: Identify the non-equivalent expression. Only **D** omits critical terms from the expanded form.

B. 2
C. 8
D. 14
E. 110",D,"Step 1: Calculate the attic floor area.  
Floor dimensions: 25 feet (length) × 35 feet (width).

E. $5,250,000",C,"Step 1: Identify the tax rate and owed amount. The rate is $42 per $1,000 of value, and the tax owed is $5,250.  
Step 2: Set up the equation: Tax = (Estimated Value / 1,000) × 42.  
Step 3: Substitute the known tax amount: $5,250 = (V / 1,000) × 42.  
Step 4: Solve for V by multiplying both sides by 1,000: $5,250 × 1,000 = 42V → 5,250,000 = 42V.  
Step 5: Divide both sides by 42: V = 5,250,000 / 42 = 125,000.
