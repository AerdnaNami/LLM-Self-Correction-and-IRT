1,M130101,"Yvonne has studied the cost of tickets over time for her favorite sports team. She has created a model to predict the cost of a ticket in the future. Let C represent the cost of a ticket in dollars and y represent the number of years in the future. Her model is as follows.
C=2.50y+13
Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","A. $5
B. $8
C. $13
D. $18
E. $26",A,"Step 1: Identify the given model for predicting the cost of a ticket: \( C = 2.50y + 13 \).
Step 2: Determine the value for \( y \) which represents the number of years in the future. Here, \( y = 2 \).
Step 3: Substitute \( y = 2 \) into the equation to find the future cost of the ticket.

\[
C = 2.50(2) + 13
\]

Step 4: Calculate the value.

\[
C = 5 + 13
\]
\[
C = 18
\]

So, the predicted future cost of the ticket after 2 years is $18.

Step 5: Identify the initial cost from when \( y = 0 \), which is \( C = 13 \).

Step 6: Determine the increase in cost by subtracting the initial cost from the future cost.

\[
\text{Increase} = C_{\text{future}} - C_{\text{initial}}
\]
\[
\text{Increase} = 18 - 13
\]
\[
\text{Increase} = 5

Each term after the first two terms is found by taking one-half the sum of the two preceding terms. Which term is the first odd number in this sequence?","A. The 5th term
B. The 6th term
C. The 7th term
D. The 8th term
E. The 9th term",C,"Step 1: Understand the given sequence and the rule for generating terms.
The sequence given is: 40, 8, 24, 16,...
Each term after the first two terms is found by taking one-half the sum of the two preceding terms. 

Step 2: Calculate the terms starting from the 5th term using the given rule.
- The 5th term = (1/2) * (4th term + 3rd term) = (1/2) * (16 + 24) = (1/2) * 40 = 20
- The 6th term = (1/2) * (5th term + 4th term) = (1/2) * (20 + 16) = (1/2) * 36 = 18
- The 7th term = (1/2) * (6th term + 5th term) = (1/2) * (18 + 20) = (1/2) * 38 = 19
- The 8th term = (1/2) * (7th term + 6th term) = (1/2) * (19 + 18) = (1/2) * 37 = 18.5 (not an integer)
- The 9th term = (1/2) * (8th term + 7th term) = (1/2) * (not applicable, as the 8th term is not an integer)

Step 3: Identify the first odd term in the sequence.
We see that the 7th term is 19, which is an odd number.

Answer:
C. The 7th term",C. The 7th term,1

C59 = SUM (B6:B57) * C3 * F3  
                 OR
Mary should add the values in cells C6 through C57.","Answer:
To calculate the total amount of taxes paid for the year, Mary needs to multiply her hourly pay by the tax rate, and then multiply that result by the total number of hours worked in the year. Here's the formula she can use in cell C59:

C59 = C3 * $F3 * (Type # of Weeks Mary worked in the year * 6)

Assuming Mary works 5 days a week (as shown in Jan 6, Jan 7, Jan 8, Jan 9, and Jan 10):
= C3 * F3 * (78 * 5 * 6)

The number 78 represents the approximate number of weeks in a year (52 weeks + 2 weeks in case of leap year).

So, if typing out step-by-step:

1. Identify the hourly pay in cell C3.
2. Identify the tax rate in cell F3.
3. Determine the total number of weeks worked (78 weeks).

6,M180201,Prove that A'C' ≅ D'C' and give a reason for each statement in your proof.,,"The proof aims to demonstrate that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.

    Starting Information (Givens): The proof begins by stating two pieces of given information:
        Point C is the midpoint of the line segment BE.
        Angles B and E are right angles.

    Using the Midpoint Definition: Since C is the midpoint of BE, it divides the segment into two equal parts by definition. Therefore, line segment BC must be congruent to line segment EC.
    Using the Right Angle Information: Since angles B and E are given as right angles, and all right angles are congruent, it follows that angle B is congruent to angle E.
    Identifying Vertical Angles: Angles ACB and DCE are formed by the intersection of line segments AE and BD. These are vertical angles, and vertical angles are always congruent. Thus, angle ACB is congruent to angle DCE.

    Proving Triangle Congruence: Now, comparing triangle ACB and triangle DCE, we have established the following congruencies:
        Angle B ≅ Angle E (Angle)
        Segment BC ≅ Segment EC (Side)
        Angle ACB ≅ Angle DCE (Angle)

        The proof uses these findings to declare that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE. The reason cited is the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate. (Alternatively, since these are right triangles, the Leg-Angle (LA) theorem might be considered, although the established parts fit the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) pattern: ∠B ≅ ∠E, ∠ACB ≅ ∠DCE, and the non-included side BC ≅ EC).

    Final Conclusion (CPCTC): Since it has been established that triangle ACB is congruent to triangle DCE, all their corresponding parts must be congruent. Line segment AC in the first triangle corresponds to line segment DC in the second triangle. Therefore, by the principle that Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent (CPCTC), we can conclude that line segment AC is congruent to line segment DC.","Answer:

B. 2
C. 8
D. 14
E. 110",D,"Step 1: Calculate the area of the attic.
The attic area can be determined by multiplying the floor area by the height of the attic (without knowing the height at this point, we can calculate the floor area.
Step 2: Understand the total area of the attic that needs to be spread out.
The area is calculated by multiplying the length and the width of the attic.
Step 3: Calculate the exact amount of attic do we are going to buy for him.
Step 4: Calculate how many rolls of insulation to buy for him.
Step 5: Calculate whether there is enough -- and/or-- insufficient information for the height.
Step 6: Calcuate -- and/or-- if -- or maybe even less than what we need for higher up insulation.

Answer: We need to know the attic's height -- to get the total number of insulation needed.
Step 8: Get the actual number of insulation by dividing the area of the attic by 64 square feet.
Step 9: Calculate 15.625 (round up to 16 because we can't have a fraction of insulation.

Answer: John needs you know more to find the right number, but we ARE NOT knowing the attic's height, which -- or know more information -- like, For example, he doesn't have certain amount of information we need to compute with a square root already shown in a square root -- rather than a decimal.

To calculate the correct number, let's detail it out, let's start with: Counting exactly how many we need the attic's height to start & finish.

Step 1: Understand that the attic area is the product of length by the width.
Step 2: To compute the unknown -- do specify the attic's height -- so I can't make up quantitative output representing the total number of insulation needed to know the answer:
E.g., John only needs to know all the dimensions we need for the that attic height: accounting for both the length and width is required to answer correctly.

To figure that out, let's show how, e.g., John only needs to know a few more factors regarding the attic's geometry to figure out the number of insulation rolls needed. The exact number of insulation rolls needed when knowing the attic's height is: [exact number of insulation rolls needed when knowing the height of the attic is: [exact number of insulation rolls needed when knowing the height of the attic is: [exact number of insulation rolls needed when knowing the height of the attic is: [exact number of insulation rolls needed when knowing the height of the attic is: [exact number of insulation rolls needed when knowing the height of the attic is: [exact number of insulation rolls needed when knowing the height of the attic is: [final answer based on given dimensions and choices provided]

Step 1: Calculate the area of the attic floor as a product of the length and width.

The formula used is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Step 2: Assuming the dimension height was not provided, we have to recall that we don't have the dimensions such as height before moving next.
e.g., John only needs to know a few more factors regarding the attic height to figure out the correct answer.

Step 3: Given we've only found the area derived from dimensions length and width, let's follow by:
\[ \text{Area} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 35 \, \text{feet} = 875 \, \text{square feet} \]

Step 4: Now we calculate the number of rolls by dividing the area with one roll coverage:
\[ \text{Number of Rolls} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Coverage per Roll}} = \frac{875 \, \text{square feet}}{64 \, \text{square feet per roll}} \approx 13.58 \]

Step 5: Since part of materials can't be bought, round up to the nearest whole number to fulfill John's needed requirements.

Final step: Therefore, John needs 14 rolls of insulation if you knew the attic's height to factor into the dimension calculations for the correct answer.
Answer:

B. 38
C. 42
D. 60
E. 65",C,"1. Let's call the height of the bird's nest H.

2. We are going to determine the height H, we need to find the vertical distance between the ground and the bird's nest using trigonometric functions, but the tree and the bird's nest forms a right triangle with the base as 50 feet. We can use the tangent function in trigonometry.

3. We will use the tangent function, which is the ratio of the opposite side (the height) over the adjacent side (distance) in a right triangle. So:
tan(40° = H/50

4. Solving for H, we will rearrange (H/50 = tan(40°), thus, H = 50 * tan(40°).

5. Using a calculator or trigonometric table, tan(40°) ≈ 0.8391. Thus, H ≈ 50 * 0.8391 = 41.955 feet.

Answer:
Answer: 42 feet.

1. First, we'll simplify the expression (16^(1/2)^3
2. Recognizing that 16^(1/2) is the square root of 16, which is 4
3. Then we'll consider that 4^3, which is equal to 4 * 4 * 4 (4 * 8
4. Multiplying these together, 4 ^ 3 = 4 * 4

Answer: 
B. 64

 Chain of Thought:

1. We express the given number in the form of a power of that number, 16^(1/2)^3 
2. First, simplify the expression by taking the square root of 16, which is 4

1. Finally, we'll consider that 4^3, which is equal to 4 * 4 * 4, then we see that 4^3 = 4 * 4 * 4 = 64

So, the correct answer is 64.

Answer:
B. 64 

Chain of Thought:

1. First, let's re-express 16^(1/2)^3 by considering the properties of exponents.

(16^(1/2)^3 = 64

2. First, we'll simplify the exponent (1/2) inside the parentheses.

(16^(1/2)^3 = 16^(1/2 * 3)

3. When multiplying the exponents directly, (16^(1/2 * 3) = 16^3/2 = 16^(9/2)

4. Now, we express 16 raised to the 9/2th power:
(16^(9/2) = (2^4)^(9/2) using the fact that 16 = 2^4
5. We simplify the expression (2^4)^(9/2) using the property of exponents where (a^(m*n) = a^(m*n):
(2^4)^(9/2) = 2^(4 * 9/2)

6. Now, we multiply the exponents:
4 * 9/2 = 36/2 = 18
7. So, we have 2^18

8. Calculating 2^18 might look complex directly, but starting with:
2^4 = 16
9. Now, let's consider (2^4)^4 = 16^4 = (2^4)^4 = 2^(4*4) = 2^16

10. We are interested in 2^18, which can be expressed as:
2^18 = 2^(16 + 2) = 2^16 * 2^2

11. We already know that 2^16 = 65536, as well as 2^2 = 4
12. Thus:
2^18 = 65536 * 4 = 262144

However, we missed an exponent simplification step earlier, which might matter because we should clearly consider (a^(m/n))^p = a^(m*p/n). Let's recompute while addressing the mixed fraction simplification again:

1. Look again with: 16^(1/2)^3 = 16^(1/2 * 3) = 16^(3/2)
2. Thus, we use the identity 16 = 2^4:
2. Then, 16^(3/2) = (2^4)^(3/2)
3. Apply they exponent multiplication: (2^4)^(3/2) = 2^(4 * 3/2)
4. Simplify the multiplication: 4 * 3/2 = 12/2 = 6
5. So 2^(4 * 3/2) = 2^6 = 64

So, the correct result is:
