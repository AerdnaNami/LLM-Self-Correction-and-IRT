B. a(x+y)+b(x+y)
C. (b+a)(y+x)
D. ax+by
E. ax+bx+ay+by",D,"Here's my answer:

**Chain of Thought**

1. Start with the given expression: (a + b)(x + y)
2. Using the distributive property, expand the expression: ax + ay + bx + by
3. Now, consider option A: (a+b)x+(a+b)y
4. Can we simplify this expression? Yes, we can distribute (a+b) to x and y: ax + a(x+y) + b(x+y) = ax + ax + by + by
5. Simplify the expression: ax + ax + by + by = 2ax + 2by (oops, looks different from the original expression)
6. Therefore, option A is NOT equivalent to the original expression.
7. Repeat this process for the remaining options:
	* Option B: a(x+y)+b(x+y) = ax + ay + bx + by (matches the original expression)
	* Option C: (b+a)(y+x) = by + ay + bx + x (not the same as the original expression)
	* Option D: ax+by (different from the original expression)
	* Option E: ax+bx+ay+by (different from the original expression)

1,M130101,"Yvonne has studied the cost of tickets over time for her favorite sports team. She has created a model to predict the cost of a ticket in the future. Let C represent the cost of a ticket in dollars and y represent the number of years in the future. Her model is as follows.
C=2.50y+13
Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","A. $5
B. $8
C. $13
D. $18
E. $26",A,"Here's the step-by-step chain of thought to solve the problem:

1. The question asks how much the cost of a ticket will increase in two years, so first we need to find the cost of a ticket in two years using the model.
2. The model states that the cost of a ticket (C) is equal to 2.50 times the number of years in the future (y) plus 13.
3. To find the cost of a ticket in two years, substitute y = 2 into the model:

C = 2.50(2) + 13
C = 5.00 + 13
C = 18
4. This means that the cost of a ticket in two years will be $18.
5. To find the increase in cost, subtract the current ticket price from the future ticket price. Yvonne didn't mention the current ticket price, but we can assume it to be $13 (which is the constant term in the model).
6. The increase in cost is the difference between the future ticket price and the current ticket price:

Increase in cost = Future ticket price - Current ticket price
= 18 - 13
= 5
7. So, the correct answer is A. $5.",A,1

4,M135401,"A cat lies crouched on level ground 50 feet away from the base of a tree. The cat can see a bird's nest directly above the base of the tree. The angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest is 40°. To the nearest foot, how far above the base of the tree is the bird's nest?","A. 32
B. 38
C. 42
D. 60
E. 65",C,"Here's the solution using chain of thought:

1. The cat is 50 feet away from the base of the tree.
2. The angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest is 40°.
3. This means that the bird's nest is above the base of the tree, forming an angle of 40° with the ground.
4. To find the height of the bird's nest, we can use the tangent function: tan(40°) = opposite side / adjacent side.
5. The opposite side is the height of the bird's nest, and the adjacent side is the distance from the base of the tree to the cat (50 feet).
6. So, we can set up the equation: tan(40°) = height / 50.
7. To solve for height, we can multiply both sides by 50: height = 50 * tan(40°).
8. Using a calculator or a trig table, we find that tan(40°) is approximately 0.839.
9. Substituting this value back into the equation, we get: height = 50 * 0.839 ≈ 41.95 feet.
10. Rounding this answer to the nearest foot, we get: height is approximately 42 feet.

C. $125,000
D. $220,500
E. $5,250,000",C,"Here's the step-by-step chain of thought:

1. The tax rate is $42 for each $1,000 of estimated value, which means that the tax rate is $42 ÷ $1,000 = 0.042 (or 4.2%)
2. The property owner owes $5,250 in property tax, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Tax = Property Value × 0.042
$5,250 = Property Value × 0.042
3. To solve for Property Value, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.042:

Property Value = $5,250 ÷ 0.042

How much would it cost to mail a letter that weighs 2.7 ounces?,"{'A': '55 cents', 'B': '66 cents', 'C': '77 cents', 'D': '88 cents', 'E': '99 cents'}",C,"Here's the solution using Chain of Thought:

Step 1: Determine the cost for the first ounce
The cost for the first ounce is 33 cents

Step 2: Determine the cost for the additional ounces
The letter weighs 2.7 ounces, so we need to round up to the next whole ounce. The additional ounces are 2.7 - 1 = 1.7 ounces, which rounds up to 2 ounces. Each additional ounce costs 22 cents, so the cost for the additional ounces is 2 x 22 = 44 cents

Step 3: Add the costs for the first ounce and the additional ounces
The total cost is 33 cents (for the first ounce) + 44 cents (for the additional ounces) = 77 cents

1. Let's call the area of the rectangle ""A"". Since the rectangle has a length of 2 and a width of 18, we can calculate the area as:

A = length × width
= 2 × 18
= 36

2. The area of the square is also equal to 36, since it has the same area as the rectangle.

3. Let's call the side length of the square ""s"". Then, the area of the square can be written as:

A = side × side
= s²

4. Since the area of the square is 36, we can set up the equation:

s² = 36

Based on the information above, about how many riders out of the 13 scheduled would not keep their reservations?","{'A': '1', 'B': '3', 'C': '5', 'D': '7', 'E': '9'}",C,"Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. An advance reservation is only cancelled about 40% of the time. This means that 60% of the time, the reservation is kept.

2. Since there are 13 scheduled riders for each van, 13 * 60% = 7.8 riders (approximately) are expected to keep their reservations.

3. 13 - 7.8 = 5.2 riders (approximately) are expected not to keep their reservations.

If Fred's age is represented by F, which of the following represents the ages of Rosa and Byron, respectively?","{'A': '12(F-1) and F-1', 'B': '12(F+1) and F+1', 'C': '2(F-1) and F-1', 'D': '2(F+1) and F+1', 'E': '2F and F-1'}",C,"Here's the solution:

1. Rosa is twice as old as Byron, so if Byron's age is B, Rosa's age is 2B.
2. Fred is one year older than Byron, so Fred's age is B + 1, which we can represent as F.
3. We can set up an equation using the information that Fred's age is B + 1: F = B + 1
4. We can substitute F with B + 1 into the expression for Rosa's age: 2B = 2(F-1)
5. Substitute B + 1 for F in the equation: 2B = 2((B+1)-1)
6. Simplify the equation: 2B = 2B + 2
7. Subtract 2B from both sides: 0 = 2
8. This is a contradiction, so the equation we started with is invalid. Let's go back to the original expressions and see if any of them match.

Looking at the options, we have:

* A: 12(F-1) and F-1
* B: 12(F+1) and F+1
* C: 2(F-1) and F-1
* D: 2(F+1) and F+1
* E: 2F and F-1

Comparing these with the initial equations, we see that:

* Option C: 2(F-1) and F-1 matches the initial equations

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Answer: C",C,1
17,M130001,A particular flu vaccine is effective for 90 percent of the patients who receive it. What is the probability that it will be effective for both of the next two randomly selected patients?,"{'A': '0.54', 'B': '0.63', 'C': '0.72', 'D': '0.81', 'E': '0.90'}",D,"Here's the solution using Chain of Thought:

**Step 1:**
Let's identify the probability of effectiveness for one patient: 0.90 (given in the question)

**Step 2:**
For the first patient, the probability of effectiveness is 0.90. For the second patient, we need to find the probability of effectiveness given that the first patient was effective. Since the vaccine is effective independently for each patient, the probability of effectiveness for the second patient is still 0.90.

**Step 3:**
Now, we need to find the probability of effectiveness for both patients. We multiply the probabilities of effectiveness for each patient:

0.90 (probability of effectiveness for patient 1) × 0.90 (probability of effectiveness for patient 2 given patient 1 was effective) = 0.81

**Step 4:**
We can simplify this result by multiplying the probabilities:

0.81 = 0.9 × 0.9

**Answer:**
0.81",**,1
18,M127901,"An election involving four candidates for mayor has been held. Of the following, which is the best way to present the percentage of votes each candidate received?","{'A': 'Circle graph', 'B': 'Line graph', 'C': 'Box plot', 'D': 'Scatterplot', 'E': 'Histogram'}",A,"Here's the chain of thought:

1. An election involves four candidates for mayor, which means we have a categorical variable with four categories (candidates).
2. We need to present the percentage of votes each candidate received, which means we are looking at a proportion or frequency variable.
3. A circle graph (also known as a pie chart) is a common and effective way to display the relative frequencies of a categorical variable.
4. The circle graph will allow us to easily visualize the proportion of votes each candidate received, with the size of each section of the circle representing the percentage of votes.
5. In contrast, a line graph or box plot would be better suited for displaying continuous data, while a scatterplot or histogram would be better suited for displaying bivariate relationships.

19,M135301,"The town of Mayville taxes property at a rate of $42 for each $1,000 of estimated value. What is the estimated value of a property on which the owner owes $5,250 in property tax?","{'A': '$42,000', 'B': '$47,250', 'C': '$125,000', 'D': '$220,500', 'E': '$5,250,000'}",C,"Here is the solution:

1. Let's start by identifying the given information: the property tax rate is $42 per $1,000 of estimated value.
2. The problem states that the owner owes $5,250 in property tax.
3. To find the estimated value, we need to convert the property tax to a value per $1,000 and then divide by the tax rate.
4. Convert the property tax to a value per $1,000: $5,250 ÷ 42 = ?
5. Divide by 42: $5,250 ÷ 42 = 125
6. Multiply by 1,000: 125 × 1,000 = 125,000

Answer:
C) $125,000","C) $125,000",1
20,M127001,The number of bacteria present in a laboratory sample after t days can be represented by 500(2t). What is the initial number of bacteria present in this sample?,"{'A': '250', 'B': '500', 'C': '750', 'D': '1,000', 'E': '2,000'}",B,"Here's the chain of thought:

1. The number of bacteria present in the sample after t days can be represented by 500(2t).
2. This equation is in the form of ""number of bacteria = initial number * growth factor"", where the growth factor is 2t.
3. Since the initial number of bacteria is being sought, we need to find the constant factor that is being multiplied by the growth factor.
4. To do this, we can set t = 0, which means the number of bacteria after 0 days is the initial number of bacteria.
5. So, we can substitute t = 0 into the equation: 500(2(0)) = x, where x is the initial number of bacteria.
6. Simplifying the equation: 500(0) = x, which means x = 0.
7. However, we know that the initial number of bacteria cannot be 0. The sample must have had some bacteria to start with.
8. The closest option to 0 is A: 250.

Answer: A: 250",A: 250,0
21,M135401,"A cat lies crouched on level ground 50 feet away from the base of a tree. The cat can see a bird's nest directly above the base of the tree. The angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest is 40°. To the nearest foot, how far above the base of the tree is the bird's nest?","{'A': '32', 'B': '38', 'C': '42', 'D': '60', 'E': '65'}",C,"Here is my chain of thought:

1. Let's break down the information given: a cat lies crouched on level ground 50 feet away from the base of a tree, and the angle of elevation from the cat to the bird's nest is 40°. This means we have a right triangle with the cat as the base, the distance to the nest as the opposite side, and the bird's nest as the vertex.

2. Let's use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation and the distance to the nest. Since we know the angle is 40°, we can set up the equation: tan(40°) = opposite side / 50

3. Since tangent is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, we can convert the angle to radians and use a calculator to find the value of tangent:

tan(40°) = 0.8391 (approximately)

4. Now we need to solve for the opposite side (the distance from the cat to the bird's nest). We can multiply both sides of the equation by 50:

opposite side = 50 * 0.8391 ≈ 41.95

5. Finally, we can find the height of the bird's nest above the base of the tree by subtracting 50 (the distance from the cat to the base of the tree) from the total distance:

height = opposite side - 50 ≈ 41.95 - 50 ≈ 8

22,M130101,"Yvonne has studied the cost of tickets over time for her favorite sports team. She has created a model to predict the cost of a ticket in the future. Let C represent the cost of a ticket in dollars and y represent the number of years in the future. Her model is as follows.C=2.50y+13Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket increase in two years?","{'A': '$5', 'B': '$8', 'C': '$13', 'D': '$18', 'E': '$26'}",A,"Here's the chain of thought to solve the problem:

1. We are asked to find the increase in the cost of a ticket in two years, so let's start by finding the cost of a ticket in two years using the model.

C = 2.50y + 13

We are asked to find the cost two years from now, so y = 2.

C = 2.50(2) + 13
C = 5 + 13
C = 18

2. The cost of a ticket two years from now is $18. To find the increase, we need to find out how much more that is than the current cost.

3. Let's assume the current cost of a ticket is x. Then, the increase in two years would be the difference between the cost two years from now and the current cost.

Increase = C - x
= 18 - x

4. Since we don't know the current cost x, we cannot find the exact increase. However, we can find the maximum possible increase by assuming the current cost is 0.

Maximum increase = C - 0
= 18

5. We are given five options to choose from. The correct answer would be the option that is closest to $18.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Answer: E",E,0
